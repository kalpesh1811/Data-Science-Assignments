"I am using this neck band about past 12 days and writing my review. I used this earphone with bike travel,  pubg , alone in room, noisy crowded places and in office. i am writing this review from my own perspective. Medium level of volume (60%) is enough for me through the day for call and music and it have charge upto one and half day.1.Good audio quality-  4/52.Decent Bass - 4/53.Good battery backup  - 4/54.Quality material -  5/55.Ergonomics - 4.5/56.Mic - 2/57.Gaming - 4.5/5.Everything in this product is fine until online call comes. It have two mic on the headphone. i don't know which one is pickup the noise in online call. when we use this headphone for online calls the mic works absolutely terrible for me. It is very responsive and pickup the tiny noise very far from the mic and not picking up my voice. i tried with wtsapp, Duo,Skype and Zoom call. It is frustrating for me all the times.I checked with one of my colleague's earphone it do have the same issue as mine.Noise cancellation during bike drive works is still not up to satisfying. it work sometimes and most of the time the opponent hear only wind noise. I tried to block the wind by placing the neckband below my shirt's collar,, still wind noise is there. Apart from that, the mic works decent in normal calls.During PUBG, i don't feel any latency issue with this and also no audio or mic issue."
"Overall a good earphone but not a good sounding headphone.If you're looking for anything that sounds good, has natural lows , warm and and deep mids, sparkling and clear highs ? Go for anything but not this. Soundstage wise , they're horrible, bass is artificial, there is absolutely no imaging. The depth in the audio sounds like a 8bit Audio played on 1995 Walkman. Highs are absolutely absent. This is just very very bad sounding headphone.But, if you don't care about Audio Quality in the Music and like anything that has good battery, charges superfast, sleek and well built, produces stupid bass for IDK what reason. Then you might like it.I don't like it and I won't recommend it. (Tested on 24bit 96khz FLAC/ALAC files)"
"I received package but in box I got a broken data cable. Amazon again defaulter with its service.After got my refund, I purchased it from local shop. I impressed with its design and flexibility around the neck. Sound also great. But with in 15 days left side part stopped working and this time I surprised because I'm the person who cares alot of my products. One plus service center changed it and provide me a new earphone.If you are thinking to purchase it..no doubt it's a great product.It's produced a balance sound that's all."
"In the previous model, we could easily switch between two connected devices. While hearing  TV / laptop/ ipad output on the Bluetooth, one could switch to the phone or any other connected device  with just a double click on the power button. This was such a super useful feature of this device in the previous version. THE NEW MODEL DOES NOT  HAVE THAT OPTION!! I tried  all possibilities and read through the manual.. No .. NOT AVAILABLE!! This is. Ridiculous and feel so cheated.. how could they strip off such an important and very USEFUL feature!  I am appalled and deeply disappointed.  Can’t return it.. only replacement is allowed. !! How could the company be so stupid and thoughtless."
It is wrong on part of Amazon to club multiple products into one and project ratings together as one. Also when it is updated it should be sold as a different item if the features are considerably changed. The ratings also become misleading here.The previous version of this product had a smart switch. It allowed you to toggel between two different phones/devices. E.g. you are listening to music from your laptop and receive a call on your mobile. Simple click that button and take the call. Now this button has been removed which is a big disappointment.
"Excellent headphones. I use them a lot - listening to podcasts when I'm pottering, music when I'm running, for every phone call and video conference. The ...The warp charging is amazing - combined with the automatic off when they dangle round your neck (magnetic buds), it means I just never run out of battery. 10 mins of charging keeps them going for a couple of days of use for me.They connect to my phone automatically and very quickly when I snap them apart. A button on the neck band switches the connection quickly to my laptop and back.Sound quality is excellent and they're pretty comfy. The fit in my ear isn't quite as good as I've had with some other in-ear headphones, but they stay in well enough for use on long cross-country runs."
"Built - good built as expected, band is soft silicone, one side three button control with charging port which shockingly have no cover on it, all other cheaper alternative have.Connection - no issues fast seamless,Sound - main features is sound quality, as it is bass edition, so mote than enough bass, compared to other owned earbuds like cross beats evolve not as par to it, it sound like a SMALL SPEAKER IS SOUNDING A FULL SOUND, whereas boat rokerz 385v2 sound like a big home theatre system sounding, and sound is not balanced as it is bass edition.Bass, mids, vocals can heard clearly and separately but quality not up towards crossbeats.Charging - super fast,Verdict - other alternative at cheaper price bracket like boat, noise can be recommended over this."

 Very bad product quality.I did buyed two Oneplus bullet Z headphone due to good noise cancellation for wfh. Both both stopped working within a month out no where. 1st one mic stopped working, and for second one headphone total dead. Only good thing is with lots of hassle you can get a replacement which takes near about 15days."
This is my second purchase of this earphone. This is a great earphone.Pros-------Great sound quality (4/5)Bass is excellent (5/5)Call quality (5/5) - so far nobody complained about my calls and it is crystal clear.Noise cancellation good (4/5)Comfort in the ears (4/5) - please choose the earbuds according to your comfort. The small one looked more comfortable for me.Battery backup is excellent (5/5) - You can easily get 12-15 hours of playback/call time.Magnet ON/OFF switch is great - this helps in not using the battery when magnetic switch is paired. With medium to heavy usage the battery last for 3+ days easily.Fast pairing is great.Build quality is excellentCons-------No switch for pairing with multiple devices. You need to manually do this.Even though the earbuds are comfortable you may feel slight discomfort after using it for longer period continuously.Highly recommended for anybody who is looking for a decent Bluetooth headset.
"This review is not for amazon or the customer service but for the oneplus warranty claim process. First of all once you contact the oneplus warranty helpline they will ask for your original box of the bluetooth earphones whoch you received a year ago(which totally doesn't make sense for anyone to keep the cardboard box with you forever) for the product to be eligible for warranty even if it is under 1 year warraanty terms. secondly, you need to be on a call for 35 mins to install an all new app to book for a service later which will get rejected for some dumb reason. The whole process of applying for warranty is an pain in the a*s in oneplus. I would suggest you to apt for some other brand for a better quality of service. Oneplus warranty claim process sucks."
When you want to dream about something while watching videos or PRETENDING TO BE SEEING THE NEWS AND STUDYING.IT'S AN EXCELLENT WAY TO GET YOUR OWN SENSES DOING WHAT YOU WANT OR YOUR BRAIN WANTS TO DO... USE THESE HEADPHONES... WOW.. I WAS IMPRESSED BY THE QUALITY OF THE TREBLE MIDRANGE AND BASS SOUNDS AND THE SOUND OF THE AUDIENCE IN THE LIVE MUSIC VIDEOS... BUT YOU TEND TO DREAM MORE THAN WORK.. IF YOU TOTAL YOUR WORK AFTERWARDS WHEN THE MUSIC STOPS... 🎧🍷💭🎶🎵🎼😳👀..THAT'S SOUND SCIENCE TOO GOOD KEEP IT UP... WOW...
"I had high expectations from these as I am a loyal user of JBL, bought these basically for office calls as the battery backup was good, after using them for approx 2 weeks I can say I am disappointed. Earphones aren't very comfortable to wear for more than 30 minutes due to the shape of it, listening to music is a  bad experience feels like you're using some 50rs cheap headphones the only good thing i battery, everything else is just a pain. Please don't buy these"
Don't buy this product.Whe we hearing songs or watching movie the sound was soo good. But while calling some unwanted nois hearing that was such a irritate noise. Sometimes the Bluetooth also dis while calling. Mic also too bad.This headset give good experience in hearing songs onlyThis same kind of problem repeated in many OnePlus headphones
"I have been using them for a year and half. And here is my review:Pros:Strong build quality- i often fall asleep wearing them and have travelled so much with them but there hasn't been any wear tear on the earphones.Fast charging- 15 minutes is enough to completely charge them with a one plus charger. If you're in hurry then put it for 2-3 minutes and I would work for hours.Great battery- along with fast charging the battery back to is great. It can with for upto 24-36 hours non stop.Noise cancellation- This is a big thumbs up for those who are looking for an earphone majorly for call purpose. It has good noise cancellation and the sound is captured perfectly.Packing- comes with good packing, you can considering giving it to someone for gift.Cons- Not a good choice for music. It doesn't have good bass which I am sure a lot of people look for when it comes to music."
"After one month of use, honest review.Everything is good sound, battery backup, connectivity, look and noise cancelation but Chinese product remains Chinese.Sorry to say but the volume, play/pause button fell off suddenly somewhere while neckband was in my ear and it shows no sign before so that I could have fixed it.It just fell off.Everything still works fine but I don't have buttons to increase/decrease volume, play or pause In neck band."
"Cummon OnePlus, what the hell are these!!!They are supposed to be the ""Bass Edition"", however, there's NO BASS. Absolutely disgusted with the sound signature. The highs are killing my ears, feels like I have placed really crap tweeters in my brain. DAMN... This was a bad purchase!Updated: After one day if use, crackling sound on calls, disconnects and reconnects to the phone on its own, it is super irritating. No return policy on the this one, have asked for a replacement.Update (Replacement Unit): Absolutely horrible product. The same issues as the previous unit. STAY AWAY!!!"
"This review I am writing after 1 month usage. Firstly let me say that I am a moderate user of this item. I used this Bluetooth headset for calls, audios and music.Pros:1. One plus being an elite brand has tried to maintain a decent quality of the product.2. Bass & Treble performance - deep bass delivery is satisfactory. High pitched notes could be made better. I am a fan of Jagjit Singh and his ghazals were all upto my satisfactory levels.3. Tried it using inside trains. At 75% volume level outside noises were mostly eleminated. Outdoor ambient noise was also blocked when used during brisk walking or trolling. Choice of volume level is upto the hearing perception of an user. So I am not commenting more on this.4. Call reception quality is good enough.5. If you use it at night in a dark room with some classical songs playing....simply you will love to continue to play.6. Lastly the sound delivery does not distort even at higher volumes which is a great positive factor to me.7. Battery backup is satisfactory. It never runs out of charge. After 2 hrs of listening charge dips 10% only which is acceptable.Cons:1. It could be made a bit sturdy at this price.2. The thin round wires coming out from the headband will tend to tear at that place because it is a weak joint. It could be made better.Overall if you can spare a bit much from the ranges around 1100-1300 then this won't turn you down. I am happy using this item as of now.Choice is yours. Best of luck."
"It works fine for music but whenever you want to make a call there is a cracking sound coming from it. I replaced one but the next one is also showing the same problem, they have managed to produce a damaged product , it's their in built fault and they are not going to fix it until and unless someone filled a complaint at consumer court and make them pay for their dishonest business.."
"Pros:Best in class sound and great bassGood for all music genresReasonable priceGood balance of mids, lows. The upper highs are little muffed and could be a problem for hard rock lovers. But you can make any headphones work as per your needs with the equalizer on your device.Cons:One star less because they didn’t put the quick switch button on these ones. The old ones without the bass edition had a quick switch button. I can live with that but the convenience is missing in these ones. My solution press and hold the middle button and then switch in the mobile device for connecting."
"It is good in all aspects. I purchased 4 numbers of OnePlus Bullets Bluetooth Wireless Z Bass Edition in Ear Earphones with Mic (Black) for me and my friends. The performance of the sets is good and the battery charge is sufficient for the full day. For one of the sets, Magnet was dropped and lost somewhere after 10 months of usage. Replacement is denied as the magnet is not found. Another set stopped pairing after 2 Months. Oneplus service center replaced it with a new set on my request."
"The earphones are great for music, can't deny that. And they worked great for calls as well, for the first few months. But later, they started developing these issues where it would create a really disturbing noise during calls which both you and the other person can hear. So bad that you'd prefer talking on the handset rather than bear that sound. YouTube is filled with solution videos and comment sections filled with this same issue. So this problem is not unique to my case. This was not expected from OnePlus. What does one even do with great sound quality when they have to disconnect the earphones every time they get a phone call? This is a highly frustrating experience."
"The product is good overall..1, Battery : The battery life is best. It really gives 10 hours charge with 10 minutes charge. It has fast charging facility. For battery, there is nothing to worry.2, Sound and bass: It has high bass..But I personally don't like it for the bass. If you are a music lover, you can feel the vocals and other instrumental sound are slightly distorted for the bass, I say slightly, not so high .If you want a balanced audio stay away from it, or you can use the regular edition. But if you are a bass lover, thats a perfect option for you. And I feel a little crack audio while listening to music. That's can be for my phone problem, because, when I connect it with my laptop, there is no such problem. So, I think to return it.  There is no quick switch option in the bass edition.  That may be helpful for you to buying it."
"Writing this review after 5 days:Oneplus did a great job with this earphones.Sound Quality: Sound and Bass are Amazing as mentioned everywhere. Comfortable for all type of uses like Calling, Music, Movies, etc.Build Quality: Such a premium build quality, not gonna break easily and with nicely box packing, every essential items are given like extra earbuds and charging cable. It feels very light wearing it, You can wear it all day without any problem.Eveything is great with this, only I had a problem with in-ear-fitting as the earbuds are little bit of big for my ears, I solved the problem by changing the earbuds to small ones.Conculsion: Over all it's a good product if you're looking for a good neckband earphones. I totally recommend it under ₹2k (Worth It) 👍"

 I am writing this review after 5-6 months of purchasing this item.. very bad static sound is coming during call. This problem is very prominent you can even check it on oneplus forum, people complaining about the same issue. You just won't be able to fix it in any way. Resetting or whatever you do it won't fix it. I mean why would you waste 2000 rupees if this is what you have to face in 5 months? And keypad also fell off after 3 months of use. Can't believe.. it was only good for first 4 months."
"The first pair I ordered had an issue in the left ear plaug and I got the headset replaced.The repclement worked fine for 2 days. It lasted only 30-45 mins of use. I assumed I was not charging them enough.Now its been on charge for the last 5 hrs and its not powering up.Can be a unique case, howvever it takes away my confidence from the brand."
"Guys its sound is not much impressive, I have used realme ear piece which is of 1400 bucks. Sound and mic quality is far better in realme compare to this 2000 bucks of one plus. I am feeling like i wasted the money and product is not up to the mark.Dont go for it. Its really not that good as youtubers are claiming for it. It sound like just an average ear piece which you can get in 1k product. Mic quality is some what above that average still NOT VALUE FOR MONEY.DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY FOR THIS."
"Sound Quality: GoodConnectivity: not up to mark, looks like it's not Bluetooth V5Working great with OnePlus 6, qual quality too bad with poco F1Music quality good with all devices I useBattery n charging: GreatI'd go for Infinity 120 for connectivity ( I can connect two phones at the same time)For battery: OnePlus hands downNote: I've used both, I enjoyed infinity more for half the priceI had requested for replacement of my copy, Amazon didn't process my requestSad times"
"build Quality - 8/10LightweightBASS is ok in this model as well, not much bass you will feel but still good it will save yourear.Sound Quality- PC Windows 10- 5/10 (Very Low Sound tested in HP Zbook)- iPhone  - 9/10- Android - 9/10 (I don't have 1+ phone )- Samsung Android Phone - Sometimes Disconnection issue is identified- Mac - 9/10Call Quality -- PC Windows 10- 5/10- Iphone  - 9/10- Android - 9/10 (I don't have 1+ phone )- Samsung Android Phone - Sometimes Disconnection issue is identified otherwise (9/10)- Mac - 0/10 - received call from facetime - cannot talk , low voice is reaching to the caller.Connection Speed -- Windows 10 PC - Takes Some time to connect 8/10- MAC immediately connects (9/10)- iPhone (9/10)- Samsung phone (9/10)"
Overall Good product but When travelling Outdoors the Noise Cancellation is almost Zero.Firstly Dont buy this product if you always use it Outdoors because the Noise Cancellation is Almost Zero.The opponent cant hear your Voice clearly because of Background Noise.Apart from This the Earphones are amazing in terms if Sound Quality.
All thos Mother!@#$%^&* who aporeciated this one plus product mast have done it for paid.its no where near to realme earphone which comes in 1799 ..only problem with realme earphone is that its wire used to break from the main machine ...or else i would have bought realme earphone for third time in 2 years....but i bought this One plus product in 2000 rupees which is just a trash .One plus is useless earphone
"Sound - ExcellentNoise cancellation - GreatBass - perfectBattery - best in classFit - I see this as the only challenge... Though it fits well in your ears, the challenge I observe is when we have to use it for long... It happens to hurt your ears a bit because iktye size is exactly as your ears, design is great but the hard part of the earphones starts hurting after a couple hrs use.. may be it would fit some oneelses ears perfectly well, infact it's a good fit to my earas as well but yes I do have to just the earplugs after a couple hrs continous useRest everyhing is unmatched"
"This the replacement of the fault one. I bought for fire time to gift my wife and eventually it failed to work within two days. But I crossed the replacement period. Still after explaining Amazon representative, they accepted to replace and provide me a new one. I mean, the Amazon representative guy was very helpful. The replacement one is working excellent. Thank you Amazon"
"Hi, I am using this product from last January 2022. Product build is good. But product quantity is bad. So much disturbance while making calls. I went to OnePlus service center for replacement, they said like...if they replace also you will face the same problem again, you have to update the mobile software, insted of changing the ear phones set. Moreover I am having OnePlus mobile phone. Even with same brand it is nor supporting well.  It is having issue with the software. My suggestion is, don't buy this ear phones. My rating is zero🌟. I have seen lot of compliaints at the service center, all are related to same modal of ear sets only."
"This is the best bluetooth earphone I have ever used. Unmatched sound quality, ease switch between songs / connecting or disconnecting calls.The best thing about this is the battery back up. Literal 5-10 minutes of charging would give a 100% charge.  Although it depends on the usage, but a moderate use can still make the battery last for 3-4 days. I love the magnet at the end of the earbuds to save the chare.You don't need to think twice before getting this one if you are looking to buy a good quality bluetooth earphones."
"Pretty good and decent Bluetooth device. I am very happy with the sound quality and the fast connection. Really happy with the magnetic on/off feature as this helped me a lot. In the other bluetooth devices, when the device is paired but not on your ears, you don't hear the ringing if one calls using MS Teams. Here as you can keep the device off when you remove from your ears, you don't miss it. However, at times, the earpiece gets disconnected from the other especially when you move your hands. Also, at times, the length is a bit nuisance. Also, feel that it would be even better if the battery life could be higher..  At times, the battery lasts only one day, but able to manage."
"Average quality. Not worth spending 2000 on this headphones. I read in one of the review that the headphones produce a cracking sound. I ignored it thinking that it would be one very random case. But, to my dismay, the pair that I received always produces a cracking sound while increasing, decreasing the sound or when switching over to a new song. Couldn't help but there it away and bought the Jabra 45t. Much much better than one plus"
"Though the sound/bass quality is good, the product is very unreliable and flimsy. Right side buds stopped working within 2 days of purchase. Also, there was a cracking noise heard during phonecalls which is very disturbing. Got a free replacement from Amazon as per their policy. The replaced product also had the same issues. Was denied another round of replacement by Amazon, thus had to visit a OnePlus exclusive service center. They took more than a week's time and gave a replacement which they claimed to be a new product. These ""new"" earphones won't get charged and are unusable. OnePlus is not offering pickup-drop service for repair due some technical issues. Highly disappointed with the entire turn of events and experience. Total waste of time and money."
"The lack of the good one 'Quick Switch' button is the main problem. I used the original edition for 1.5 years and it got wear off due to heavy usage and I had to purchase a new one and I bought this one few days back and I am okay with the purchase but the main problem is the missing of 'Quick Switch' button and I never thought that would be an issue but it sincerely bothering me just too much that I have to leave a single star review for its successor.We few compare original edition with this bass edition:Quick switchOld: YesNew: NoBattery backupOld: 2.5 to 3 daysNew: 2 daysBass (rating 1-10)Old: 8New: 8.5 (it's not worth the hype)Charging timeOld: 1-1.2 hoursNew: 1-1.2 hours (Its the same)Convenience (1-10)Old: 10New: -1 (lack of that damn quick switch)My final rating for original and bass edition (1-10)Old: 9.8New: 6.5Conclusion: Go for the original edition if possible, if you haven't used to quick switch this one might be fine for you but if you constantly listen on your computer and switch to your phone for call or something the quick switch button will ease up the pairing task to such an ultimate level.If the review help, give a LIKE for being a savior :)"
"I had used the original Bullets Wireless Z for around 14 months. And never needed to use anything else. Although I have a pair of Sony WH1000XM3, but they were convenient enough to accept the worse audio quality. My originals started giving me issues with the mic and remote. Which was caused by usage in light rain as far as I can tell. So I got the new one. I initially thought that the only thing different between the two was the audio tuning. Sadly, I was wrong.First of all, whats similar between the originals and bass edition.Same comfort- Can comfortably wear it for hours without fatigue.Support for Warp ChargingPrice.What's not same?1) Significantly cheaper build. Since, I have both the versions, I can compare the two side-by-side. It's lighter but not in a good way. The wires feel flimsier.2) No quick-switch button- It was such a huge game changer for me. I used the original Zs with my phone and laptop and could switch back and forth between the two without having to fiddle around the settings. Although now you can connect to 3 devices simultaneously, which is a feature that I like and will use, but I am not sure how relevant it is for others.3) Worse battery life- Just by the specs, the company quotes lower battery life. This is a bummer as the improvement in audio quality is barely noticeable when compared to the decrease in battery life.4) Worse latency- I had used the Original Zs with oneplus 7T and 9 pro and nothing could beat the latency on the originals. While playing PUBG on pro-gaming mode, the latency was imperceivable. But here, it is certainly noticeable. Let's see if this can be improved with a software update down the line, as it did for the original Zs.5) Positioning on the mic- The original Zs had the mic between the neckband and the bud itself, on the left ear; which brought it at a very convenient place to take, decline calls, music controls and in general have better mic quality for the person on the other end. The Bass edition has the control/mic incorporated in the mic. It annoys me to bits when people on the other end complain about static noise being generated as a result of the mic rubbing on my shirt collar. And this also makes it virtually impossible to take the calls while on the bike. The original Z's mic could be tucked inside the visor of the helmet.It may seem like that I have crapped all over the headset, but it mainly owes to the fact that I had grown used to the original bullets wireless Z. It is still a decent buy. But only buy it if you're going to use it on a oneplus device. For other brands, I'd recommend look elsewhere."
"I like the prduct due to its sound quality and the amout of noise cancellation that it provides at this price point.However, online meetings at laptops and computers revealed an potential issue with this. If you are infront of the laptop (may be within 2-3 feet) other will not notice any issue. As soon as you move beyond that you are not audible or your voice will decrease significantly for others in the call, forcing you to maintain the very small radius. This negates the purpose of having  Bluetooth headphones.So, for cellphone its ok but for office meetings you will face issues."
"I have purchased this two times, once a year ago from offline market at the same price, and second from the Amazon 1 month ago.After the unboxing i noticed, the box is little changed and premiumness is decreased if you have old version you can check it, one more wierd thing I wanna include, the cable of old version is 0.25inch bigger than this new one. Means seriously brand? (Cost cutting ki hadd hoti he)Let's come to the review now, yes after using this for small period, as always it's comfortable and long charging holder deivce ever, noise cancellation is awesome, cups you can change as per the given Options which allows to get an awesome comfort.One more thing, there are lots of features fixed in buttons but aren't mentioned in manual or website (again cost cutting)(1)press middle button once=video pause, play, call pickup & hang up a running call.(2)hold middle button=reject an incoming call & get Google Assistant support.(3)press middle button two times during music or video=forward.(4)press middle button 3 times during music or video=backward.(4)press vol up n down both=shut down."

"Definitely good for Mobile. Sound quality is good, You can hear podcasts using it without any problem. They are loud so 70% volume is good enough. but when i connected these to my mac, there is static heard in the first day itself. Not sure why it's not compatible with Mac. Mike quality is ok, but if you are planning to buy for office calls, better avoid this.  This is first two day review though."
"I purchased this product after seeing 4+ rating. However, its not that great.Also its not too bad either.I was expecting exceptional sound quality like we used to have in Sony some 10-15 years back.Sound is not very crisp. Even bass quality is just ok. Overall not outstanding experience.Plus point is that it's very comfortable to use and seamlessly connect.Price is more than the peer products, thats the reason I was expecting this one to be outstanding."
"I was already having one earphone earlier a year ago  but due to some miss happening it got damaged.I ordered another but the quality is not up to the mark.During a voice call there is so much of disturbance in between, have to disconnect it and connect it again .Secondary the Bass version is so bad that the audio quality of any song or movie you play the sounds echoes and you can't even hear it clearly .Will Return It Very Soon ."
Bass (Low frequency) - 9/10Bass (Mid frequency) - 6/10Mids (Vocal/speech/instruments) - 7/10Highs - 6/10Sound Isolation - 6/10Build quality - 9/10Noise Isolation - 8/10Noise Cancellation - NA (Active Noise cancellation not present)Volume - 10/10 (12mm driver rocks!)Bluetooth Connectivity (Mobile/Laptop) - 9/10Bluetooth Range - 10/10 (~8m through multiple walls without any disturbance)Battery Backup - 4-5 HrsLow frequency bass is high and sometimes it shadows mid frequency bass. It could have been better if mids and highs are a little bit amplified. Set audio EQ carefully to get rid off it. Overall sound quality is good. Volume is too high because of 12mm driver which is helpful to hear audio/speech in noisy places.Connectivity is crazy! I am using it for long calls (Both mobile and Laptop) and never faced any issue with connectivity and range.

 Worst quality product do not ever buy one plus BluetoothProduct quality is very cheap and only last a monthWorst product ever"
I purchased this for my poco X2 phone and the first was not connecting with my phone and if connects then disconnect automatically and will not connect again for hours then after restarting multiple times it will connect again so I went for replacement. I got replacement and there was no connectivity issue but when I am on call there is always some static background noise and it was so bad and loud that I had to return the product.
"I purchased it as its one plus brand, connectivity is good, calling is also nice, but if you are bass lover, you will be highly disappointed. Sometimes sound goes creepy as well. It looses the quality a bit. If there’s any return option I would like to return it.In the same price range you’ll get better neck bands."
"-I used ""Blaupunkt BE50 XL Bluetooth Wireless in Ear Earphones with Mic"" - Its music is best in class but call clarity is not good because of high bass output in calls.-I used ""boAt Rockerz 330 Pro Wireless Neckband with 60HRS Playtime"" - Sorry to say, this is the worst earphone I have used in any category. Its music is very poor, all the music comes into the center and nothing to hear in a dolby surround level. Call clarity is also very poor. Only thing is, it has huge battery backup.-Finally I bought ""OnePlus Bullets Bluetooth Wireless Z Bass Edition in Ear Earphones with Mic (Black)"" -1. It has good Music, Nice bass, nice treble, good mid and vocal - You'll love it if you are a music lover.2. Call clarity is superb, either you are on phone or on zoom, crisp and clear.3. I used it continuously and its battery is superb with almost 17 Hrs of music play and calls.4. Charging time is 1 Hr 15 Mins.5. Easy to connect, light weight.No Negatives to say as of now..."

"Recently I had to retire my Jabra elite 25e after 3 years of usage, before that I used Samsung level u for 2 years. After a lot of research, I have ordered Blue Parrott M300XT which is a big disappointment for INR4300/- (Not from Amazon)No battery backup (2.5 hrs against claimed 14 hrs), faulty model, ear pain, heating issues, low volume.My gamble to try a new model has failed and instantly I had to look for a reliable neckband under INR 2000/- as I have already burnt my hands. Oh boy! Oneplus has not disappointed.Pros:-1. Instant pairing attach and detach2. Good environmental noise cancellation even at 60% volume3. Quick charging4. good range (This something very tough to comment)5. Detach to answer the call feature is great6. Comfortable earplugs (Jabra Elite25e and Samsung levelu I had ear fatigue)7.  Lightweight and adequate wire length.Cons:-1. Should have included a mute button (only jabra elite models have it)Verdict:- If you are looking for a no-fuss comfortable reliable neck band go for it.Oppo M31 has less battery and Real Me buds earplugs are big, Level U is bulky.So ONEPLUS BULLETS WIRELESS BASS Edition is an allrounder for INR 2000/-Don't expect a noise-cancelling mic like Poly Voyager 5200 it's made for different use case."
"Nice sound amazing productSo coming from a quality wired earphones to this neck band (RIP headphone jack) this wireless band cant bridge that gap.PROS-Awesome battery life,Great quick switch functionality (not available in BASE EDITION, great job one plus marketing team),Quality phone calls (get it immediately of u spend long time in meetings or calls) WFH Fever,Type C and fast charge (minor but still its there)Even the band to ear bud wire length is different.. had difficulty in position with my shirt collar. BASE EDITION legth is not enought. Stupid company. Had to return Bass Edition due to removal of quick switch and reduced ear cord length.CONS--Music will become less enjoyable so buyer beware,BASE EDITION-Music does feel good but one plus cleverly REMOVED the QUICK SWITCH and even positioned the MICROPHONE on the neck band directly while in NORMAL EDITION it used to be on the control island thingy with volume.Any physical changes must be highlighted. Guess one plus no longer enthusiast brand."
"Sound, Bass and Noise Cancellation are excellent but the battery backup is not as mentioned in the production description so it's a wastage of money as it doesn't meet the expectations. I suggest all not to buy this product with the price of ₹1999. I also returned this after finishing the battery backup issue.This product worth only ₹700 not more. Microphone is also not working, sometimes it stops working in between."
"""Bass boosted"" is upto its name.Absolutely fantastic sound quality, noise cancellation etc, especially with a oneplus phone the compatibility is just amazing!With non OnePlus phones, experience might not be the best, all cool features don't work as well."
"Useless fellows.. I bought a one plus earphone in black color and earpads are in red color.. my invoice and warranty card has bold black...we thought that our earphone is black color only.. now it's not working properly for few weeks.. went to service center and they are telling that the item color is *Reverb red*. And warranty is void... How come a common man know the minor differences they have in their product. We just bought it in Amazon and kept all invoice , warranty slip and even the earphone boxes safely...but still warranty void... You are making mistakes and somebody else to pay for it... stupidity..."
"No doubt other headphones are much cheaper than this with the same features but while using this no one will regret his/her decision of choosing it. Amazing built quality, premium look, soothing audio and everything is good except battery life for those who have used boat headphones will feel battery life poorer in comparison but its ok for daily use once in a day needs charging and provide whole day battery backup."
"It is the best under 2000 for calls, music and gaming but if you compare it with high end earbuds like Sony XB-WF700 then those will blow this out of water in sound quality and rich bass. In these bass is high sound quality is ok but in high end earbuds it's not crystal clear. Don't think that these sound crappy no no these sound good and for 2000 these are the best value for money."
"Pros: Lightweight & Fast-chargingCons: Sound clarity, Bass, Microphone placement, Battery Backup& Build Quality.P.S. Earlier  non-bass edition was very good. This version is bad. I don’t recommend."

 I had bought these earphones around 10 months back, one side of it stopped working so I claimed it's waranty and was provided a new pair in March 2022. While I was on a call today, it automatically got disconnected from call and started giving a static/hissing sound. It isn't getting switched off, neither does hard reset work. Charging the set doesn't work. At this point I literally feel like crushing this with a brick?!! Such poor quality product.Have been a die hard fan of OnePlus but you've lost me in recent times.One plus sucks!!?!!"
"There is crackling sound in the background that comes during calls games music anything randomly. During calls, once the crackling starts, it continues. It is known issue with the buds, and you need to reset the device to get it back, and then again the crackling starts2nd time am purchasing the same but very very disappointed. Previous model itself having quick switch option, but this model not having.It's mentioned in the features that bass edition have quick switch option, but their is no quick Switch Button. Don't know why they have mentioned it in the features. I guess they have just copy paste features from their older edition to bass edition."
"I was order this product as birthday gift to my wife. I was order this 13 days before my wife's birthday. I received it within 3 days. After I keep it as it is in a safe place without  open this. On birthday I present it to wife. She is happy but after 1 day. She complaint me this product is faulty after That I tryed to return but Amazon's 10 day return policy is over so I contact to OnePlus service center. Service said to me first they test to this product for 3 days and then they deside to replace or not. I have no choice but want to say to OnePlus service center, ""this is a very bad customer service.""  Also in future I never buy OnePlus's any product. Good bye OnePlus."
"Have been using the first handsfree for continuous 2 years which still looks like new product to me... Would have continued using same if my brother wouldn't have stepped on it... The current model has been changed and looks too delicate too, the wire might get cuts soon also have re-ordered the product as the replacement was cancelled but still facing the battery issue with the product.."

 Microphone recurrent problem….. replaced 3 times … 4 th time OnePlus service centre denied to replace or repair…. Don’t buy this product… go for something else … there r very good product available… but please don’t buy this . My experience with OnePlus is very bad .. I won’t buy any products of OnePlus company."
"I have received a product with very good packing. As usual one plus box is beautifully designed for its customers. Here are some pros and consPros:- Premium Packaging- Bass and Trible quality is awesome- Elegant design- Stylish look- Quality is awesome wrt price- Quick pairing esp when you are using oneplus device- Supports Type C charger and quick chargingCons:- Should improve the wire quality of Right and left earphones- Should have provided the carrying pouchI really love this amazing product ! Can't expect oneplus would provide quality product with awesome sound quality at this price. Previously I have used Bose Soundsport, Galaxy buds+ Jabra 65T and out of all Bose Soundsport is one of the best headphones and Oneplus is now in that vision."
"Writing this review after using it for 15 days. I am using it by paired with iPhone7 and believe me it is one of the best neck band, I have found.iPhone7 has Bluetooth version 4.0 and in some reviews I read it is compatible with Bluetooth 5.0 and latest versions. But, I haven't yet faced any single issue related to connectivity or latency in voice.Hats off to its battery life. In 15 days I have charged it for twice only.I was very confused before buying it due to review I found here, but believe me and buy it without any second thought."
"I earlier had the normal Z and bullets 2. But this one seems to me worth a deal. For its price the sound and battery is very good. I don't think bass lovers would be happy with this bass. But clarity is good. Sound seperation and sterio imaging is also simple if that's gets you well. I hope it had the button for multipoint, that's the biggest bummer from these though not a huge one but still bothers when u need to switch in between. So if you just want a decent sounding earphones and just want to carry it during work, workout or anything for casuals it will be a good deal. But if you're looking for audio quality wise, then it's not the best specially in this price range what else can u hope, with AAC codec only."
"After receiving the earphone today, 1st impression of sound quality was bad as i was there was crackling sound when listening to YouTube video songs in Mackbook Pro. But when tried in Pixel phone, it was all clear. Tried in 2 other devices and audio was clear without any crackling noise. So it got clear that earphones are good, problem is in bluetooth in Macbook Pro which after reading some online resolution, got fixed (deleted bluetooth related .plist file from Library -> Preference folder and restarted the Mac). So now i am enjoying these lovely earphones. So far so good.Build quality is good. These are so light weight that one won't even notice that its around neck when worn for longer time. Switching devices is smooth even without dedicated switch button. Call quality is also Ok. Battery life not tested yet but fast charging really works. Wish they provided a longer USB-C cable, its very tiny."

"Let's see. I am Spotify's 99.98 %iler when it comes to how much ilisten to music. On an average it's 6 hours a day for last 12 years.

Won my heart. ❤️"
Pros1. Great sound effects2. Bass is great3. Bluetooth range is awesome4. Charging in 10 - 20mins lasts for 45hrsCons1. Didn't know that the device will not work when both the earpieces are attatched together(must mention that somewhere in the box)2. Did not come as a complementary with my Oneplus 8T device
Magnet of both ear buds joints Bluetooth connection gets off means disconnects from device and when you separate it reconnect to the device but it takes some time and after using 5 days now its not reconnecting. I have to go to Bluetooth section and connect it again and again. I have factory reset it but same thing happening. When i have call i put buds in my ear and wait till its connect with my phone then i need receive call from phone of switch given on handsfree. It would be better if magnetic call receive/cut system developed instead of magnetic power on/off system because magnetic power on/off system takes time to reconnect and we have to go for receive call. Device switch system is too pathetic every time you need to go for connect. sound quality is really good.
"So, I replaced my original bullet wireless bass edition when I noticed this issue and to my surprise the new replacement had the same issue. I, then, replaced this second earphone too and the third one had the same problem again. OnePlus sent me new earphones in a sealed pack every time so I'm sure it was not the same piece.With this third piece I tried all the troubleshooting possible. From resetting the network setting to resetting my one plus 7 but nothing worked. This earphone was working all fine with other phones. I tried this with my friends Oneplus 7, hoping that it would not work, but it was working fine with his phone. Even other bluetooth earphones like Sony WI-C200, boat rockerz 335 etc are working fine with my phoneThe only possible answer is that only few devices has this wireless connectivity issue with bullets bass edition version. I cannot think of anything else.TL;DR There is no solution for this issue.Workaround I've purchased the one plus bullets normal version ( not the bass edition) and this earphone works flawlessly with my phone. tbh, the normal version is better than the bass edition becuase of the handy quick switch button and for the bass, its almost the same.I'd suggest all of you to get the normal version (not the bass edition) or any other bluetooth earphone you like."
"I am using this product for quite a few months now and here are some points I’d like to mention:Connectivity : Really good 👍 4/5 (no switch option avlb!)Comfy level: Very light 🍃 5/5Sound quality: Mids(3/5) | Highs(2/5) | Bass(1.5/5 - Extra bass my ass 😂)Battery: 3.5/5 Will easily last 5-6hr on heavy use.Overall experience: 2.5/5✅ Good for regular use if  sound/mic quality is not your concern.⚠️ Not recommended for audiophiles!⛔️ MAJOR CON 🥲: The product is defective, one may hear crackling sound from time to time specially while changing volume.Had returned the product and the new one was no different.Solution(Weird / Temporary):1> Change volume repeatedly  until sound input is totally gone 😂 and then simply forget the device and re-pair. This may  work for a few hrs.2> Get use to it 😂"
"First of all ,A big thanks to Amazon for delivering this product in my village, seriously speaking I didn't expect this fast delivery in village so I am impressed 5star for delivery service also.Now about the product it's an excellent product with superb noise cancellation specs this makes it good for traveling purpose . Also the charging is c pin USB ,so you don't need to carry extra usb for it. As for sound , quality is excellent ,for almost every type of beat it sound pretty good. Overall it's worth buying at this price . You say na in Hindi ""Paisa vasool""."
"Sound Quality - 3/5Bass - 3/5Battery life - 5/5Charging speed - 5/5Call quality - 5/5Comfortable - 4/5Overall : 3/5 Not as expected 😥(Can't Return it, if it'd be possible would buy Boat 255 pro plus, But😭)Overall Okay okay, product. Not Really liked as, it is overpromoted by reviews and youtubers 🤮.[Have already boat 900 wired 😘😍 which is one of the best in the market and comparing OnePlus z bass edition to boat 900 is like - Boat 900 😍 is thousands time better in sound quality than OnePlus Z bass edition👎]Conclusion : Not worth two thousand rupees. It sounds like Boults ( 250rs )basic wired earphones😒Advice for the new buyer : if you want to listen to music (like feel) and going to watch movies or series with these, don't buy this.❌"
"Device stopped paring after 2 months use, no home pick for my location, for all East and west Godavari locations in AP. Only service center visit which only in RJY that's a Authorized one. Issues very common from oneplus, things twice before buying it who are from AP east and west."
"Review after 2 months of use:1. Battary back up is good.2. Charging speed and feasibility to charge are good. 10-15 min charge can sustain your day.3. Connectivity with paired device is good, pairing is fast.4. Switching between 2 devices could have been better and fast.5. Call quality (Specially the noise cancelation) is worst and of very poor quality. It won't cancel any noise and any environmental noise and background voice will always be very loud and hearable at the other end of call.If calling is not the purpose then it will be very good choice to buy."
"I bought this on 8 JULY 21. Looks awesome, stylish. Sound quality is great, i tried all types of music. Noise control is makes it first choice for call. Battery backup is still 4-5 days (using while driving only 2-3 hours a day). But there some cons too, the wire is little lengthy and so the left side speaker stopped working after 6 months of use thanks to the dents in the cable.I am still using this bcz i use this only when I drive.So it's 2 star for my 6 months hassle free use."
"Please don't buy this. This earphones mic doesn't work at all. I bought two and noticed it after a few weeks, sadly otherwise I would have returned it right away. I googled and found out that so many users are facing the same issue. Its like the microphone doesn't EXIST and that's not all there are these random popping/cracking noise while listening to music etc. Please don't buy this."
"Review after 20 days of useWell satisfied with the productBought for 1999/-*Good battery backup (I get 13-15 hours)*Better sound quality*Fully charged by 40 mins approx (I couldn't find when it's getting 100% charged by any indicators, I'm finding it after connected to the phone)*Noise cancelation is good*Very light weight"
"Earphone doesnt vibrate when there is a call which means i have to wear it in my ear all the time. Its such an inconvenience. The whole point of using a neck band is tht i can wear it only when i want to attend  a call or music.The magnet on the earphone is a bad bad idea.  If earphones are stuck magnetically,  tht means it is off. How can it alert me. It remains connected only if both earphones are away. Not practical at all. Cant return it either. Am stuck."
I expected better sound quality for such a price point. The build quality is good but sound did not do for me. The bass overshadowed the rest of the music due to which the sound seemed a bit muffled.Still I would recommend for the casual music listener but not to someone whose priority is sound quality and music detailing.
"works good with phone, always has bad distorted audio when connected to laptop or PC when contacted costumer care all they say is we cannot help it as it is only designed for mobile even when they havent mentioned it anywhere but says ""works with all the devices"" so even if it is not gonna work with other mobile other than oneplus they wont help even if the product is under warranty."
"After purchase 2 months it was smooth but compare to my previous or working Bluetooth (boat) it's sound quality is not good as that brand , so after 2nd month right side sound started decreasing a week later that side stop working so I thought I should exchange but that's was even worst because the service center service is so slow n unorganized that  while waiting for ur turn to just handover or for checking u have plenty time to decide wheather to leave and buy new product rather wasting time or just wait for hrs for their confirmation if genuinely product is working or not then after all of that they ask to wait for wait another 1-2hrs to provide u exchange.So after wasting my Sunday in service center I finally received my exchanged earphone n that disappointed me so well that I came back to my ex earphonesLong review but short msg not worth it is just a hyped product"
"Good sound quality and nice build quality.I really hoped it has button to switch between multiple devices which was there in normal edition which was discontinued.It's a bit annoying to manually disconnect from one device and connect from another again and again.Also, little bit sound leakage problem is there when used on high volume."
"Sound signature is goodBalanced bass and good sound clarity2 day battery backup(4-5 hours of usage per day)Call quality is good but the environment noise is not reduced, even it picks up noise from 10ft away.There are sometime the headphone is not connecting to iPhone automatically but connects to laptop automatically."
"So i ordered my first headset two days back and I am a person who uses YouTube extensively every day. I bought this OnePlus bullets wireless z bass edition earphones with lots of hope, the first 10minutes the headphone worked fine but right after that there was this crackling sound coming from the earphone which sounded like some static noise. Decided to return it back and got a replacement just half an hour before the time I am writing this review and again I am facing the same issue. Guess OnePlus failed to manufacture a reliable and result delivering product. I guess OnePlus must take this flaw as its not just me but several people have complained about this issue on the OnePlus forum too. I wish to return this one too as my main usage is for YouTube and this crackling sound is highly irritating while watching videos. PS: I AM NO EXPERT ON ONEPLUS TECH BUT THIS PRODUCT FROM ONE PLUS IS NOT ADVISABLE."
"Product is average to good. Not the best.Battery life is superb. Call quality not so good. Other person can hear all the noises around, even what's far away on the streets. Audio quality is just okay. Fragile product though. I've bought 2 of these in 17-18 months. So clearly doesn't last for a year. Bluetooth pairing with OnePlus devices is fast!"
"Real experience customer review- very Good in every aspect. Be it sound quality, durablity, mic voice quality on the other end, bass, battery is really good charge once and forget the whole day. By now i brought three of them. First got misplaced after 9 months of usage, so brought another one and two days later brought another for my brother. Its a really must have Bluetooth neckband as i have used three or four earbuds also prior this but after having its experience i am now sticking to it only.  Very light weight and very comfortable in the ears. Never gets out of the ears while running which was a great problem with the previously used earbuds. Completely Sweatproof. Connectivity is really good never gets disconnected and connect very quickly. Latency while playing BGMI is also minimal (really hard to notice). PERFECTION"
"I got an opened box with old damaged and used wireless z earphone with all pictures and box of wireless z bass edition. But almost working not bad. And also it's have some kind of earwax remaining in the buds, and i think it's none other than it's earlier user.

"Overall product is good.But I face bluetooth connectivity and charging issues within the warranty.I contacted the service center near me for replacement. They just rejected my request for some silly and weird reason - rubber cable is broken near the magnet.I ask them what is the connection between the broken rubber and my issue, they are just saying it is company policy.I am really disappointed with the service. They are wasting our time and efforts of going to service center.I suggest if there is any issue with product just check if there is any small damage is there or not.  If so don't waste your time by going to service center, just throw them out."
Very comfortable Headphone but sound quality is average bass effect is not that great i was using realme buds wireless 2 neckband it has good sound quality superb bass with decent ANC i was looking for comfort hence bought this headphone but i guess i shouldn't have compromised sound sound quality for comfort plus taking calls  while riding bike or @ crowded place realme voice  is very clear and it cuts the background noise hence no disturbance.The best comfortable NeckbandTreble is goodWorst BassNo ANC @price of 2000Mic quality is pathetic @crowded placeIf someone looking only for comfort go with oneplus but looking for good sound high bass ANC taking calls while riding bike than check Realme Buds wireless 2 with ANC
"Previously I had oneplus z bullets edition. The sound is louder than the previous one and clear as well. The only drawback I found is that if you listen to music at full volume it'll be clearly audible to the people around you, which wasn't much of a problem with z bullets edition. And also the company should have worked upon the bass more comparatively, which according to me is fine but could have been better in the case of bass edition. If this isn't a problem for you, you may go for it."
Product works fine. But there is some technical prob. In description they mentioned like we can pair with multiple devices and we can switch among them.  But that won't happen. We have to do that manually from ur connected device. And it won't switch. It get disconnect from the paired device then it will connect with another device.

 I'm using this product from last 7-8 months. & I'm glad to say that i purchased one more for my relative. I'm very curious to know that is there a problem or not & I'm surprised that both are works frequently and same.I'm definitely suggest u that if u r gonna to buy neckband for (games , music , or calling) this will beat all neckbands that are available in market.#thnx"
"1. It's really very light weight neckband, even you forget after few times that you have it on your neck.2. Balanced Sound quality and bass quality superb.3. Its build up quality superb.4. Noise cancellation really works superb in this neck band.5. Battery backup is also superb.Overall after 5 days experience I am completely satisfied and happy with this neckband.Thanks to One+ for the innovation of this Z bass edition."
"I bought it in February 2022, now it has started malfunctioning. Voice on both ends (at my end and any call receiver's end) is getting disturbed. Sometimes,voice is not understandable at both ends. So life of this product is too short compared to its price."
I was bit hesitant on reading some of the reviews but have used other OnePlus products before so took the risk. Connects very quickly to mobile or laptop. Call quality is good. Audio and videos are played nicely.Intermittently disconnected from device (negative reviews):I read this for many users and was worried but this seems to be a nice feature provided that when in not use you can hang both earbuds around neck connected at the end. This disconnects earphones from device but puts earphones in hibernate. I quite liked this feature as this saves battery when you do not want to use earphones. So thumbs up from meDevices I use with:Mobile - Redmi Note 7Laptop - Lenovo Thinkpad
Its not working good!! Its been only 7 months that I have taken this product and one side is stopped working.
"Oneplus bullet wireless Z Bass Edition is really good product in terms of its sound quality and the kind of comfort that  its material provide is unique at this price point but what is disappointing overall is the BASS which is still not up to the mark as compared to other earphones in this price segment,  battery backup is good gives usage upto 14-15 hrs on 70% volume, connection is fine, you can go for it if you just need a  clear sound and Not if you're a music enthusiast.I'm giving this review after using it for 15 days"
After going through several of wireless earphones finally chose this one..the quality is good.. comfortable on ears ....noise cancellation is good... Can't hear anything outside.... The packaging was also good got a fully sealed box which is good....also the quality of the neckband is also good... overall totally a value for money. Would totally recommend it over sony and boat!
Very handy easy to use on the go and very interesting point is it is charged for 10 minutes and you can use it for the whole day. good for listening to music without disturbing others at a very high quality and attending calls on the go or attending meeting this is very useful. Overall awesome experience. Attending phone while charging is very easy and safe with this device
"I am writing this review after using this product for 2 months.This product has nice sound quality and noise cancellation.But sometimes when i Connect to Laptop, it just shows connected to bluetooth but i cant hear other person while on call. Sound comes from system instead of bluetooth earphone. So i totally remove the device and add it again. It gets automatically disconnect and connect back.While i connect to zoom call on phone, if i disconnect the bluetooth by mistake and if i connect back, I can hear others but others cant hear my voice."
"Left side earphone not working , product still under warranty. Where to go?"
Gifted to my son for online classes and he immediately fell in love with it after using two three different headphones earlier. It makes him independent  to move to pick up a book or take a glass of water without taking off  this bluetooth earphone while class is on. Sound quality is excellent as compared to other brands and worth the money. Used it for Two months now. Happy fir this purchase. Will buy one for self also
"The worst product I had ever received from Amazon .Having lot of issues with the product.I don't advice the productworst product the sound was not at all audible and during calls the voice was terrible always some disturbance will be there for both of the parties in the call can't even hear properly what the other person is saying may be i received fake productbut previously i used to have OnePlus bullets red one that is good, now i wanted to order new one so. i kept black colour this one which turned out to be pathetic"
"At this price bracket these are the finest earbuds. No doubt,this product is value for money as well as best quality and no other earbuds can compete wid oneplus till 6-7k price range.Trust me blindly and Buy it without any second thought u will never  regret."
"Mic not work properly during callNoise cancellation very weakNot getting good sound outcome as relted to price comparisionBass also normal soft nd feel bass not come only simple hard one, treble ratio also not match properly relate to bass to enjoy musicDont go for it select any other"
"In just around 8 months, one side of the earphone stopped working for me and don't know how to claim warranty. Really disappointed with the quality of neckband, will not suggest anyone to buy. In my family two bought and same problem with both of the neckband and duration is same around 6-8 months"
"The brand name and heavy ratings made me purchase this for 2000₹. But, I feel like they've merged the ratings of previous model which has the swap button for switching between devices. Unfortunately the present model doesn't have that facility. And when talk to anyone using the headset, they can hear every unwanted sounds other than our voice, that is quite annoying. And for continuous use, I'm not getting a back up of 17hrs as they demand. The thing only I like in this is its sound quality. So guys, do think twice before your purchase rather than falling behind the heavy ratings and brand name."

 There are serious crackling issues with iPhone in these earphones, I tested it with 3 iOs devices and with my android tv also.I even exchanged it because I thought my product was faulty.But I finally had to return it.It only works well with android phones, not even android tv or older laptops.if you use iPhone, skip this product, it is not for you.Being in the 2000 INR price range that too with bass, I think that the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z ’s built quality, look and overall sound quality is really nice. The Bullets Wireless Z also fits really well in the ears. The IP55 water and sweat resistance is also a good addition.Call quality is also really nice, and pairing is fast too.If you want lower latency for gaming or some ANC, I suggest you go for Realme Wireless 2 neckband instead of this, they have better sound.The only better thing oneplus has over realme is that the call quality in realme is a little robotic, but it’s not a dealbreaker because realme also has ANC and gaming mode to reduce latency. It’s for 2299.But then again, I would really suggest to go for Realme Buds Air 2 and go wireless instead of neckbands. It’s much more convenient and they are amazing earbuds.I bought all the best earbuds and neckbands and finally found these at 3200, Realme Buds Air 2 provided me with the best experience. Nothing else came close.it was an overall great product, and this is coming from an iPhone user, so if you use iPhone or android (or even android tv or an old laptop) and you are reading this is in August-December 2021, go for Realme Buds Air 2, it’s the best product currently available."
I have purchased the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z Bass Edition (Bold Black) ( B092ZJVB6Z ) HSN:85176290 from Amazon App on 08 Aug 21. It is also inform you that One Plus wireless earphone which I have purchased is in poor quality condition. It creating some disturbed noises while we talking with someone which the other person can't hear properly. It puts me in trouble and embarrassment situations with in a week after purchasing the same and I feel very bad being an OnePlus owner. I cannot accept this from OnePlus brand. My friends were using the same brand they are also complaining about the extra noises issue. I don't know what happened to this brand new wireless earphone. I had OnePlus wireless Z before but that impressed me well due to mis usage the wire got broken. The other audio quality features is amazing and the only problem occurs during calls. Without any calls there is no use of having the wireless earphone.
"I am writing my review after using 2 product (1) 6 months usage new product. 2). 6 months usage of replacement this item. No value for money.Low quality of the neck band, it always folded. Less distance Bluetooth coverage.No caller voice quality.No much audio quality difference between oneplus and other local product.Don't buy it.  I won't like this product"
"Writing review after 2 months of use, it's a better bluetooth device from what is available in market.Pros1. Good sound quality2. Best battery backup3. Rough & toughCons1. The neckband is very slmy & soft - needs to be bit hard2. If you use with single piece in your ear ( lot of distortion )3. Very high possibility that your microphone may become faulty - happy that after 15 days use it went 👎 , but spent two rounds to one plus showroom to get it repaired.Its a good buy, but I bet it's certainly not the best in market"
Its stop functioning after 2 months of use that to again very infrequent usage. On top of that one plus service center in Pune not allowing more than 50 cases per day. I noticed a long queue outside of oneplus service center. This itself indicates poor product quality check for one plus.Sound quality is fine.
"Ordered these 2 years back and never regretted this buy!!I reffered this product to many of my friends.Everything was perfect till date.The build quality was extraordinary, super good base and everything was upto the mark.One of side stopped working after two years  , without giving a second thought ordered the same but now in black colour and guess what??...The build quality is compromised now . The wires are thin, the collar material is of low quality but there is no change in sound quality.Two years back it was a worth buy for 2k, but now it is not."
"Hi AllWriting after 1 month usePros-1- Great Design, Faster connectivity2- Fast charging3- Amazing sound quality and call clarity4- Comfortable to use and no fear of losing it as it will be around your neck always 🙂Cons/Improvements1- Some more work can be done around Noise cancellationOne plus smartphone users can anytiy go for it. Other brands also works fine with this."
"It is really worthless to buy such a costly product, full waste of money.I am facing lots of issues with the product like connectivity issue ( automatically get disconnect and reconnect after few seconds), noisy background sound while calling ( receiver & caller both the side), slow sound quality.Neither OnePlus nor amazon is helping me to get resolve the issue.As the return window is already closed, so i am unable to place return order of the product, i approached OnePlus customer care service center also but after getting it repair I am still facing the same issues.Highly disappointed with the OnePlus product and amazon services.Even after writing number of mails to OnePlus, I didn't get the right solution at all. I requested for the replacement or return of the product but found unresponsive & helpless all the time. I would like to suggest everyone not to buy this product, there are varities of product in this price range, so go for that instead of OnePlus."
"I bought these earphones after using one plus bullets z for almost 2 years. I initially had high expectations for it but it disappointed in every case.1. The sound quality is good but not that great.2. There is some noticable glitch or cracking sound whenever I use it with my laptop to attend teams call. I have to disconnect and re connect everytime it happens. It will temporarily solve the issue but re appears after some time.3. I can say the battery quality is fine but my previous one earphones are better compared to these.4. One more thing, the earphones suddenly disconnected and connected while using them.It is just 2nd day of using them and don't know how these will work in long run."
"Not working after few weeks time. Called customer care for warranty replacement, but they are telling i need to go to the service centre which is around 70 kms from my home. Basically i need to go there 2 times one for repair and next time to collect it back, which will cost more than the price of the item and my two days effort. Please don't buy this item. They have very few service centres and no door step sercice at all.."
"Everything is good with headset but the call answering feature should might be given in headset but it is not there and battery backup is very poor, after whole night charging also it is showing zero percent in morning when We try to use headset that is really upset thing in one plus bullets, it should be sorted"
"Best part of this product is , it gets charged upto 90% in really 10 min as they mentioned in product description which makes it very useful in case of low battery and you don't need to wait till hours to get it charged up again.And it is very flexible at neck side so there are very less possibilities to get it damaged because of rough use.Overall, Value for Money and go for such product which gives you such quality and durability"
"Pros: Very low latency, so it's a good one for gaming like Pubg Cod etc. Very quick charge, you can charge it for 10 min and still use it for the rest of the day or sometimes even more. For those who love to listen to music with boosted up bass, this earphone is perfect for you.Cons:  There are no cons for me as of now ,but I want to mention that if you don't like extra bass , then you might give it a second thought.Rest , it's one of the best I have used till now.Call Quality is great and also provides a good connection from a few distance.I ordered the black but received the blue, but it's fine . I am happy with my purchase"
one side of my neckband stopped working after 6 month of usage .. to be honest i never write a review for any product but ... this is really impressive ... i went to one plus experience store  they took my old neck band and they just gave me a brand new box of the same neckband .. 🖤🖤🖤🖤
"No doubt the sound is amazing.. The earphones fit perfectly but the problem is that it is not good for mobile phones. I ordered it for laptop and when i first used it in my redmi note 8 the other person's voice was breaking a lot because my intenet was on. I close my internet and voice comes clear.. Also when i am on a video call these eaphone are a waste. The video breaks for no reason. As soon as I remove the earphone the video is all ok.. I don't know why this is not fixed yet as i already saw some same reviews . But this only of you listen songs, or for laptop.. Do not buy it if you are using it for video calls on cell phone. It does not work"
"Pros.-1. build quality bahut hi achi h is prize me,light  weightt h good job.  2.fast charge very good.  3. Bluetooth pairing working very well.Cons.-1.after 5days use is headphone ka battery drain  40% bad gya h.  2.sound quality avarage hai.  3. Smart switching hona chahiye tha jada better  hota.Finale verdict- in this prize this product is avarage/good."
"This product only good for oneplus mobile users because for other brand mobiles is connect it makes crackling or poping noise its really horrible. Oneplus  need to improve for other brand mobile users ,first time i buy this product crackling sound in right ear peice I think its manufacture problem then i replace it but again same problem is occur i am really disappointEd with oneplus brand..they consider only one plus mobile user...😐"
"The mic on this phone is one of the worst I’ve seen on a Bluetooth headphone. Though the quality of the voice is adequate however it is probably the worst choice for a phone call or an online meeting. The mic, instead of cancelling noise and focusing on the users voice, cancels the users voice and focuses on the noise. It’s a horrible experience for the listener on any call. OnePlus should focus on fixing this. It seems to be more of a software issue than hardware issue because otherwise the mic picks up the voice pretty clearly in a completely noise free environment (I mean not even fan noise because it attracts fan noise like anything)."
"*Bought for ₹2000/-*Using on my Device One Plus 8T.1. Sound Quality is Good, also I have MI neckband Pro (₹1700), compared to it MI has Active Noise cancellation and ENC but for ₹2000/- one plus doesn't offer even ENC.2. Plus point is that Pairing Device became quite easy than earlier one. But Switching between devices has been removed.3. Battery backup is below average.....4. Time consuming charging... Even MI neckband pro (₹1700/-) charges faster and lasts for 4 days other hand one plus for hardly 2 days."
"Excessive voice distortion during call. I have been using one plus z and this one plus z base edition both but this is pathetic. Got it replaced from one plus store but still same voice distortion during call. Its a manufacturing defect with most of this base edition. Go to a one plus sevice centre n youll find many replacement cases with same problem. My friend also reported same l, got it replaced but still same problem.Strongly not recommended."
"The headphone is not that great. I expected a lot from Oneplus. The charge doesn't drain too fast which is a positive thing.  The noise cancellation is poor. The sound quality is average, it sounds pretty cheap actually. I personally find the magnetic thingy (where the headphones pause once the buds stick together coz they are magnetized) about the ear buds pretty annoying. Others might love it. As a casual user who only uses headphones when necessary, like crowded places or meetings, I am a little let down but I can cope. I just hope it lasts long."
Although the sound and bass is good - there is one MAJOR PROBLEM the headphone gets disconnected frequently (I'm using OnePlus Nord) and it's very irritating that every 5-10mins I need to reconnect headphone and my phone inbetween my calls or when I'm watching a movie. And now even exchange window has closed to add to my issue. My suggestion Don't Buy This Product
I am using 1+ phone so I prefered this earphone from the same manufacturer thinking of compatibility. 1+ has proved itself as a quality product however as a surprise to me the right side earphone stopped working just after 3 months of use. I have used much affordable bluetooth earphones previously and they lasted minimum a year. I didn't expect such quality from 1+ products.
Used for one week. Here is my feedbackSound quality: Don't expect bass more from this headset. Vocals highlighted more.Noise cancellation: For calls i don't have any issue. Attended multiple conference calls. Opposite person able to here my voice properly in force wind & in crowd.Charging: After charging 10mins i can able to use for 4 to 5minProblems:When you press vol +/- then able to hear some noise in the headset.
"I had purchased this OnePlus Bullets Bluetooth Wireless Z Bass Edition in Ear Earphones with Mic (Black) on 28th November, 2021 and I started using this a couple of days ago.  The battery is not getting charged at all.Only when I plugged in the redlight glows.  If I remove from the charging unit it does not powering ON.  I am not able to use this instrument at all.  It is a total waste of money. I would like to have the replacement for this at the earliest."
"Review after two month use...The sound on this buds is good if you just want to enjoy music doing outdoor activities. Don't expect instrument seperation, or clarity in mid & lows. It just gets the job done, ie. Fits perfectly in ears (in my experience), and generates decent audio for the price. battery lasts around 2-3 days in moderate use. Didn't had any problem in attending calls, the microphone is also good.Read some reviews that the earphones make some crackling sound, i also faced the same issue, but got resolved after disconnecting and reconnecting it."
"After 3 months.. the neckaband's right bud had volume issue. The volume level was too low in the right ones and not equally balanced with left ones. Resetting the device multiple times didn't help. I took the product to authorised service desk and they replaced for a new one.Note : There's no repair for this product and in the first one year after purchase, if you got any issues they'll replace your product."

 Overall Value for Money, best feature is automatically disconnect from mobile when both left and right earpiece connected together magnetically.Battery Backup - Very GoodFast Charge-  AvailableComfort- Nice 👍Sound Quality - Good ( Bass on higher side ) Higher node could be better ....but no complaints because of the price.Build Quality- Very GoodEarlier I was using OnePlus Bullet 2, got damaged after using 2 Years on regular uses....In this one I am missing quick connect (dedicated) button.Just go for it ..."
"This is really good product for music .. have really good battery backup.. PROBLEM starts only after 5-6 months of usage .. connectivity issues starts around 5th month ,it will turn on&off automatically.. then it will stop working.. it will charge but will not start and connect to any device...I have bought one on January 2021 and faded by may 2021.. and i bought again in june 2021 which lasted only for December which is y am writing this review.. Extremely disappointed.. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR LONG TIME USAGE"
"Unfortunately I was supplied defective pieces in the original supply & the replacement & therefore cannot comment. I believe the brand is good but the supplier didn't have good intentions. I was perhaps supplied returns, leftover defective pieces. Just imagine that too from Appario Retail."
This Earphones is completely a downgrade from the previous version.No Quick Switch Button. That button was very very very useful.Also one more major issue with this Earphones are cracking sound which usually comes when we are on call.
"Built quality seems to be good  material feels premium. You can get nice clearity, good for calls, video calls online classes and stuffs like that.But if you are a bass lover and you cant compromise with bass and you can spend little more than this, dont go for these earphones. I have been using wired earphones till now and my sony wired earphones with half of this price gives me great bass, balanced sound.So, if thats your case too, than these pairs may disappoint you otherwise they are good.Conclusion: not bad.  3.5/5"
"I had boat wireless earphones earlier and that was nightmare experience for me as i work in an administrative dept in a bank and have to make hundreds of calls everyday, the boat earphones didn't have noise cancellation and the battery life was like i had to charge it everyday but THIS IS A REAL FIND for me.I charge it completely and use it for a week without any worries, sound quality is decent and noise cancellation is Amazing.I dont have any complaints after a use of almost 2 months.A sure shot buy call from me."
"The item i received was working for 2-3 hrs and later the notification LED itslf was not blinking but when trying to charge, it was glowing. Anyway later the product was not functioning even i press and hold the power button for more than 20 seconds.While it was working, the following points are what I felt..Initially I was using Sennheiser CX 275s and the base & treble was equally very good.. the sound quality was pretty good and whenever needed the base was there.But in this earphones i felt like the base was more dominant regardless of what ever type of instrument used in the song..I felt the same with BOAT Rockers 255F also.."
"Some basic points you should know before purchasing this eaephone :-*Sound Quality :- the sound quality is very good, you can listen every instrumental music and different types of music without any disturbance in noise.*Bass:- when you listen any song with high bass or low bass, you gonna feel it. You can enjoy high quality bass boosted song with this eaephone (almost like you are in other world)*Calling:- the person on the call will hear your very clear voice without any disturbance. But if there is someone talking near to you then there is little bit background noise problem (negligible).* Battery Charging :- As i have 5Watt adopter, it takes almost 1.5 hour to full charge.*battery Backup :- once it is  full charged, It takes more than 15 hours to discharge. You can use it non stop for 1 whole day.I wrote down almost everything i experienced after using this earphone.It is one of the best wireless earphones in this price segment."
"I wanted headphone for office calls, I tried multiple headphones but their mic quality was not up to the mark and I had to return themI was getting confused with some of the negative reviews for this headphone but finally bought this!I am extremely happy and I am enjoying it so much! I will surely recommend this, build quality, sound quality, mic quality, battery life everything is awesome!"
"Neck band is too short and weight less comparing with the old one. It will goes on real air when I ride my bike 😂. In side my helmet old Mike is placed inside my helmet. But with the new one I need to speak louder to answer my phone calls 🙄. Bass boosted edition is a cheating logo to sell the product with the same price, because same sound quality. Not a improved one. Even bass too.Same packing.Same sound.Nothing improved.Comparing with old one Three star rating is more than enough."
"I have used several earphones that are bass heavy, and by far these are the worst bass of them all. and if u ever plan to use them with MacBook pro DONNOT buy these. there is a crackling sound and has been reported by several people in one plus forum. u can search that on google.  better go for sony earphones."
"Everything's great... Sound, the ease of using, Comfortable except the charging time and running time. Advertisement said that it gets charged in 10 mins which is not true. It takes approx an hour to fully charged it. Secondly regarding running time it, after full charge it hardly works for 6-8 hours with full usage whereas its supposed work for 12-14 hours minimum."
Pro's1. The sound quality is good enough at this price point.2. Stylish neckband with black color.3. Decent battery backup.Con's1. Multiple device connectivity2. Some laptop isn't supported3. Quick switch is only between oneplus devices4. Latest bluetooth version5. High Quality Codec Missing(LDAC)Reason for not suitable for me :1.Multiple Device Connectivity2. Music Quality3. Switch between devices4. My Laptop isn't Supported
"Brought this for MS teams calls and worked like charm for a 4 months and right in the 5th month stopped working in one ear.Just because I had removed the mesh to clear the wax deposition, the service centre refused to replace the product. If One plus cant trust the consumer, then many more users like me wont go for One plus!"
"Every basic things it lacks... Let me clear my statement. First i had sony earphone which during call has separate volume for both call and media(videos, music if u r playing still on call), but here in one plus which was my first ever Bluetooth earphone made me so disappointed and also at my choice i made lacks this feature,if u r on call and play videos or music it has only one volume bar which has not same volume of call and media... U raise the volume to hear the music call volume get high unbearably...AND when i play video while on call Nooo sound,nothing inaudible and video play in such slow motion which is not at all Normal........... I bought today and thew it alway far today itself..... Don't buy..!!!"
"Believe me, I have tried a lot of Wireless gaming headsets and this one stands best for playing Pubg. The latency is very very low and you can merely ignore it. Now I am very happy to play freely with four fingers used. Every Pubg player needs it."
"Nowadays..some decision makers in Amazon are doing wrong things to defeat Amazon growth in India. All products are selling with defects and not functioning. If Amazon head will not taking action against those Black sheeps, then Amazon will lose their name and fame. This is my fifth time feeling pathetic for purchasing from Amazon"
"I must say, this really very good product and its battery is very powerful, sound quality is also good, after a few minutes of charge it can be used for hours, I am very impress and after using this for 1 month I purchased 2 more for my brothers so I have 3 with all of three different colour. I am so satisfied with this."
"Purchase this product 1 month back, due to this reason can't replace it 😔😔😔😔.... Cracking sound is heard repeatedly while listening to any song or while watching a video. Try to report it @ service centre service centre guy told me same thing happening with his headphone. But there is no solution."

 I purchased this headphones in October 2021. Everything was fine till February 2022. Earlier one side of the head phone was not working and now both sides have stopped working."
"It is so disappointing to see that the earphones get automatically disconnected from my phone every 15-20 minutes. And no, I've no problems with my phone because I have been regularly using the OnePlus Bullets Z (normal edition) and a Boat neckband before this. I didn't have these problems with them. It's really irritating and disappointing to see this type of problem from a OnePlus product. I only ordered this Bass Edition one because I was satisfied with how my OnePlus Bullets Z (Normal edition) performed for more than 16 months. I'll have to ask for a replacement of this one because right now, I feel like I've wasted Rs. 2,000."
Once I received the product and Started using I was really awesome but after 5 months quality will reduce and we won't hear sound from one bud ... waste of money  ... I purchased thre box 3 are also having same issues
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Need to some improvements in battery backup and charging also too slow sound quality is normal but much better then Boat . If you want tension free life then go with one plus"
"Extremely Dispointed..!!!I have order this OnePlus Z bass addition but it does not coonect to my Android ( RedMi Note 9 Pro Max). I have disturburance, cracking the voice, not audioble from my side.Even i replaced Oneplus Wireless with new one under warrenty but still the new replced earphones also having the same problem of voice disturbance, craking soumd on every call.Even i'm having the Oneplus wireless new Z Bass addition earphones i need too take it off to atten the call."
"This is very worst quality in 6 or 8 months it's get physical damage or giving internal damage , and mor worst than this is its service provider or service center or call center they blame it on you damge that product and discard your warranty  ,it's worst company which have been I seen. I never trust company product ever again , I also suggest all of you also don't buy this company product.  Everything is worst of this product and company and service center and service call center"
"I am impressed with the sound quality. However if you ask my experience while I wear this during my exercise session, I won’t suggest this. Instead go for headphones or something else. They would drop out of my ears and I have to adjust them every 15secs. While stationary, they are sturdy but if you are buying it for gym, don't buy it."
"I am using bullet neck band since 2years. I don't know why, but there is a definite problem arises within 5 months and you have to go to service centre for replacement. I have purchase this 2 times in last 20 months. And run for replacement 3 times. In other words have used total 5 earphones in this period. This earphone has a very short life. After one year warranty you to make a another purchase worth ₹2000 for this neck band."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Within 3 weeks the left side plastic where Mike and button are placed, all of sudden start cracking but I have noticed it quick, this crack was looking like natural as it was not completely broken but slight crack. Thankfully there are some intensive glue in the market and because of that I am able to use it till now. Because I have applied it before this became big crack.Though two Star for the good sound, bass quality."
"After Using it 8-9 MonthsBass - 8/10Noise Cancellation - 7/10Material Quality - 8.5/10Over all Sound Quality - 8.5/10Battery Backup - 8.5/10 ( Using it for 30 min to 45 min music and videos / Day, 30 to 45 min for call/Day , i have to charge it after 3 to 3.5 days for 5 min to 20 min)"
"A perfect alternative for Boat Rockerz 255. Bass BassLight weight.Main advantage is that when both earphones are stuck to each other it disconnects from phone and saves battery. But when these are separated, they reconnect to the phone within 2 seconds."
"This is my 2 time to purchase one plus wireless bullet but this time they have introduced bass collection which is totally bogus and cost cutting product. Even you can clearly feel QUALITY DECREASED. In sound , materials, connection time , less battery. Go for another but not for this"
"Sound quality, build quality, base all good.But problem I'm facing with this wireless earphone is connectivity issue. When ever i receive call and connect earphone voice dose not come even after setting everything. It takes too long time resolve this problem every time whenever I make a phone call.  I used to do off/on, factory setting, pairing etc. again and again to receive call voice in earphone.I'm done with this. I wanted to return but returning period has passed. 🤯"
I had done the replacement of this product post using for one week. Thanks Amazon for this. But the quality of the product is worst. I thaught this coule be one sort of issue. But the noice cancellation is not working properly. The bluetooth connection breaks every 15-20 mins while running any video or audio and then again reconnects back. This is simply worst ever product. Earlier One plus wireless earphones were better and without any flaws.Stuck up now what to do. No option to return. Only replace. So think before you buy
I was more bass from earphone as it was names Z Bass edition..  but you wont get baas not even upto the mark.. very much disappointed with earphones.. especially its OnePlus. Stopped working after 7months only.. such a hopeless buy
Please don't buy guys it's very cheap headphones they selling are with thebrand names so discusting waste of money..necer buy please and I request you people are suffering to earn money and they want spend for onething to purchase they think so much but wat u people are doing taking advantage of that fear so sad plz be some humanity....y u cheating prolr by seeling low rang headphones to brand namev
"As somebody who has used Iphone earphones with an android phone, I was looking something wireless. Cause convenience.Cons: The main feature mentioned, bass, is so bad. The sound quality is not up to the mark. I feel it is too harsh. It is awful!Please don't buy this if you are a big music lover and are looking for a high quality music experience.This purchase is not even worth the price. My old 500Rs headphones used to give me better experience than this. Now I am stuck with this low sound quality stuffProsThe noise cancellation is good and buds pretty comfortable."
"If you, like me, take a lot of work calls- this headphone won’t disappoint you. Sure the sound quality is average, but what it lacks in sound, it makes up in affordability, battery life, call quality, and build quality."
"I've been a OnePlus user for the past 1.5 years, I wanted another pair of Bluetooth headphones and naturally I went to OnePlus as I've had a great experience up until then, boy was I wrong. The crackling sound is so dominant that it feels like a cheap 99 rs headphone. It's there, in ALL DEVICES, it's a software error. Biggest flop I've ever seen. Don't buy this. Period."
bad ONE PLUS HAS DEGRADED THEIR PRODUCT IN SUCH A BAD AND DIASASTEROUS MANNERdual compatibility not there no quick switchVOICE CLARITY POOR AND COMPLEX ISSUESDO NOT GO FOR THIS ANY OTHER COMPANIES ARE  FAR FAR BETTER
"I got this earphone for 1799/- as It had really great impressions. The sound quality, bass etc were great but there is a constant crackling sound which ruins the experience. First, I thought it might be manufacturing defect so I exchanged for another unit. The second one also had the same issue. I looked it up and found that this edition of headset has the issue for almost everyone except users with OnePlus phones. It seems to be compatible with OnePlus phones only. So I had no other option that to ask for refund."
"Loved the way it connects in a snap to my OnePlus phone. Yet, it disconnects often in between calls and have to be switched off and on to reconnect. Though it shows to be connected, voice and mic is disconnected. This happens on playing music too. Maybe some software glitch."
"My device is Poco F1 and when I connected the neckband with my device, while making phone calls there are so many disturbance and echoes through the Bluetooth neckband and while hearing music there is no issues. The sound quality is good and the bass is great.! This issue with the neckband is inconsistent and sometimes the issue gets cleared and when we unpair and reconnect the device, the issue still reappears. I have already applied for a replace and was able to find the same issue with the new replaced piece also."
"It works good if on normal calls or listening to songs or watching movies. But, Its absolutely not compatible with zoom calls. You need an external application loaded, to get it connected with zoom calls. Even then it has noise glitches and blackouts every now and then."
"Previously I used many such products, but there were many problems, if bass was good, then phone calls were not at all good. But this product, bass, noise canceling, phone call voice, everything is just too good"
"Absolutely rubbish. Sound quality and mic is good. But the problem is the battery doesn't last very long. As in bluetooth earphone should have a good battery life. Afterall you are spending 2k. But this one doesn't gove good battery life. There is no separate option to disable noice cancellation. Sound and mic quality is good. Band seems to be quiet strong. I think it is not very much compatible with other phone brands. That doesn't mean it wont work with other brands. I feel oneplus earphones work best with oneplus phone only. In all aspects. Pls watch proper review and comparison ( with. Realme, boat, soundcore) videos before buying."
Ideal for taking conference calls. Seems essential for any work from home professional. Battery backup is good. Missing switch between connected device option on this model. Material feel is good.
"Do not buy if you want to use it for calls, nor you or the person on other side can jear anything, chipping/cracking sound will be there for you. No one can hear clearly.Quick Switch is not fuctional, it takes 30-40 seconds to switchVery bad experience with Oneplus, never gonna trust this brand again.Music quality is goodBattery backup is good."
No doubt it is the best option under 2k price range.<-awesome battery backup.<-fastcharging works like wonder.<-Bass is good.<-noise cancellation works fine.<-Observed latency in the Audio that is bit disappointing<-built quality A1<-overall performance is great!
"Please don't buy wireless buds. But if you really want it, I highly recommend you to go for some other brand. There is a crackling sound from the budz for many users."
बील्कुल आंख बंद कर के लेलो ।बाजार मे इतना कंम्फर्ट / नाईज कन्सलेन्स / फास्ट चार्जिंग / बॅटरी बॅकअप मेरी सोच से दूसरा कोई नही ।
I had bought this after a review from my friend. Guess what this doesnt come out as I was suggested or the quality of product is dropped further. I might be dumb that I bought this even after reading very first review being a straight warning- Dont Buy. I bought neverthless. Now I repent spending 2k on this product when i could have gotten something better in low prices. Looks like One plus is just a shallow brand and stands up to saying of chinese product not lasting for long time. Wow. If I can I'd like to have my money back. But I cant.
Worst product from OnePlus mic stopped working in 2 months from purchase. Support is useless as you have to stand in queue only to hear either it's your fault or we will replace the product but it will take 1 or 2 months. Going to buy another one.Useless product.
"Oneplus wireless bullet Z bass edition.They worked fine till first month of usage, later started giving a buzzing sound on every call which could be heard by the other person on call as well. After reading more about it, seems that wide no. of users have had this problem with no fix available till now. Awaiting replacement!"
OnePlus is a top notch trusted product now. I recently got note20 from samsung after using OnePlus 7 pro for 2 yrs but trust me no one can beat one+ . This headphone is another example of it .. pure sound and bass .love it go for it.
"I was expecting a similar experience with this earphone which I got from the old bullet wireless. But somehow it's not the same.1. Quick switch feature is not as easy as compare to the older version.2. Unlike the older version, microphone is present in the neck band itself. I liked the way it was in older version.Apart from above two things, overall nice experience with the earphones."
"I was using the old model, one plus earbuds which has a quick switch feature, which is very handy to switch between the devices. Keeping that in mind I brought this model and now I regret buying this, the feature is not available in this model and now It is hard to switch between my laptop and mobile."
Sound quality is ohk not so good and not so bad no noise cancellation so if ur in crowded place u will not able to talk Bluetooth range is so good and battery backup is also good
This item is very nice and smooth.  But one side is defected and low sound. This price is very high but i want to return immidiately. Amount Rs.  1999.00 will be return given detail account as soon.  Then when did pick up this item ?
Jo purana wala version tha iska wo best quality ka tha is neck bend se aap calling karna to bhool hi jaobass version ke naaam kaata jaa rha h acha walaBattery backup bahut hi ghatiya h waste of money joJo acha product tha wo in lovo ne band kr diya OnePlus Wireless Z only
"Cheap quality in the name of Brand.Bluetooth keep connecting and dis-connecting on every another call. After every call, it needs to be reset. Seems to be Bluetooth chip used in there is of around INR 100/- only. Overall product is to be like of INR 250/- only.Do not buy it. Its wastage of time and money."
Most i like power on off switching settings in this neckband awesome sound quality not a loud but without loud a gud quality sound with a medium bass enough if high bass for call use cant listeen call audio clearly sound quality call noise cancellation medium bass neckband and wire bud buttons r really gud quality not breakable for gud quality neckband and and music quality this one plus bullets is really gud enough
"Firstly, I was very much confused about which earphones to buy, i have also check many youtube videos to get the best neck earphones...believe me this neckearphones are just awsome go for it guys....you will not regert after purchasing it, i am damm sure. Dont be confused if your budget is below 1500 i will suggest wait for 10-15 days and then try to increase your budget to 1900 and go for this earphones. I suggest dont go for good product just go with the best one. This is the best earphones i could suggest u.Thankyou"
"Even if my headset is OP 7t still it's latency is significant.they say that it's latency with OP devices are null. But it's not right atleast in my case. Gaming mode also doesn't help in this particular area.when you watch it ruins the dialogues of every movie and videos becouse of horrible latency. Guys you can have this band on neck if you are okay with laency thing. Sound quality is okay,Bass is good I must say,and design and finishing is best,I mean it can be reffered as OP brand's work. Thanks"
"Waste of ₹2000.  Don't go for this bad product. I'm using this with OnePlus 6t device. But, After 3 week of use ,I start facing lots of problems.1. Call quality is very very bad. During calls the sound is distorted, like crack sounds.2. After 3 weeks of use ,I feel the volume of this device become low ...Overall the multimedia use is good. But I don't know why I'm facing problem during calls. Receive cracked voice..I really disappointed by the #oneplus"
"I purchased these headphones second time as the voice in the earlier one was breaking intermittently. I thought it might be due to rough handling.But after purchasing second one, the disturbance in calls is more frequent than the earlier one. All the headphones are having the same defect and the manufacturer did nothing to cure the same over a period of time. I am again searching for headphones which have clear voice quality."
"Best bluetooth headphone in this range probably, descent bass good design comfortable in ears ultimate battery backup and yes i know much of you expecting noice cancellation yes it works but not like apple buds but am sure u can hear that music when ur travelling in 120kms speed also and other can hear u on call with little bit of air go for it dont think much u cant get apple on this range i have experimented like lot of wireless but this is the one"
"Good purchase,i feel like i have invested my money in right thing.Its a perfect neckband for every purpose and connectivity is also very nice,Thank you Oneplus for such a wonderful product and thanks to amazon also to deliver it so quicky. Go for it.Sound quality is best,bass is best,you may have to change the buds according to the size of your ears and buds of every size is present in the box so.Good product,go for it."
Reveiwing after 2 years of use very good product comfortable for long use base is also good connectivity is instant after 1 year of use some time it didn't connect for call but after some time it works normaly which is normal for any earphone.
"only audio quality is good, no switch between devices, dual pairing, quick switch every thing is just on paper, auto off when magnetic buds sticks together it's too much of automation leads to ear phone is not in on condition when needed."
I’m a big fan of One plus productssecond time I have bought these. This time the product doesn’t work only. Waste of my 2000/- . I am highly disappointed. My review is very late. Felt like sharing with the company. May be it helps them to get better.I ordered another brand cheaper instead of going through customer care. I wish it was easier to get things fixed. One plus being such known trusted brand.
"Update after 1 month of use.I am facing below issues.-1. There is crackling sound in the background that comes during calls games music anything randomly. During calls, once the crackling starts, it continues. It is known issue with the buds, and you need to reset the device to get it back, and then again the crackling starts in 3-10 hours.2. In middle of call it disconnect and reconnect after around 1 min, So I have to switch my phone output from Bluetooth to normal phone speaker and I am missing miss the conversation within that time period."
"I bought this product for good sound with bassMajorly every beat should touch the ear but this OnePlus Bluetooth is not giving beats as expected . I was disappointed at beat soundsBut overall performance, durability , sound quality, Wight of earphones  and battery performance are actually extraordinary.People can go ahead to buy this earphones 🎧"
"I have tinnitus and my ears start ringing like crazy if I use certain earphones. This is great for me, that being said, anyone who likes deep bass might be underwhelmed by it.I wanted to reach out to fellow people who had yo deal with tinnitus that escalates due to bass, this might work for you."
Noise cancellation is very bad some times my voice delivery is bad and disconnected my bluetooth and talking phone please improve the quality of noise cancellation other is good but noise cancellation is most important in a traffic we can't talking on bluetooth ear phones ( iam talking with my phone some times) not useful some time this wireless earphone please update on next model this features
Value for the money .... Better sound quality than Mi Neck band priced near 1900 ...far better than Boat earphone priced near 1700... working range is decent and better than other two...Only drawback is no noise cancellation...  But overall i am hapoy with the purchase..

 I have been using oneplus bluetooth earphones for almost 2 months. I liked its charging quality.  What I liked the most is its sound quality which is much better. I think at this price perhaps this very good earphone has come from OnePlus so I would suggest you to buy this earphone if you are spending up to ₹2000."
"I bought this for WFH calls. Needed a good noise cancellation mic. This solves the purpose well. Also the music quality really good.However, multi-device connectivity or a button to switch between laptop and mobile would have been really good."
I bought this product around mid Jan and it’s not even a month and it’s not working . It’s practically dead. The Bluetooth doesn’t connect and pair anymore. It is a total waste of money
"Ah! Ear soothing sound. Good deal in this price. Build quality is superb. If you charge it for 20 min you will hear for next 8-9 hours easily, which is quite good. But if it's compared to sony, it gives a healthy competition. The only point where it looses is the bass quality.Sony provides deep amount of bass as compared to this one.But that's fine.You won't be able to differentiate, when you get use to it."
Sound quality is very good. Bass quality is also good. Voice that other person hears on opposite side of phone is also superb & clear. Only problem I'm facing is that their is a lag when I connect it to my laptop with wifi or internet access is on. It doesn't work smoothly with internet on in the laptop but with internet off it works fine. Another big issue is that the mic doesn't work with video calling in via laptop. It's very much compatible with phone but the feature lags or doesn't work with laptop properly.
Honestly there is a cracking sound that comes randomly during calls and while listening to music. I'll distrub ur music experience. I replaced that item but the newer one also comes with the same problem. Seriously OnePlus must look over that problem.Other than that Device quality and noice cancellation and battery life are good enough.
"This earphone is best for calling & connective things, bt I personally don't recommend for music lovers because when it comes to listen to songs or music this could be worst experience.NOT RECOMMENDED FOR MUSIC LOVERS."
"I have bought this headphone 3-4 months ago, till time they work properly but now one side earphone is not working, i tried to register complaint for repair purpose, but they are not giving service, the excuse for it they don't have service center near about my location.If you cant give service outside your service center area than you also not sale the product outside your service center areaShame on one plus"
"Thr bass of the earphones is very poor. Ngl the sound quality of the earphones is good but the only thing that sucks about this earphones is there bass, so if you are a fan of songs like hip hop and stuff, this are not the earphones you should buy. Apart from that the battery of this earphones is fabulous. It's true what they said, with 10 mins of charging you can literally use this earphones for atleast 3 hrs maybe even more."
I am not a reqular music listener. I need blutooth headet for calling as i have to be on call max 9 hrs continously. I can say this headset is one of the best in this class. No pain in ears after 9 hrs. Battery is good and i use it continously for 9 hrs and still can go more. Mic is awesome. No one complaint about my voice or any disturbances. Music quality and bass is also good. Only issue i see is mute option is missing on this headset.
"Worst product, even the damages happened because of product quality.. between 1 to 3 months you will start facing problem.. The service quality is worst. They won't help you for anything. I am a one plus customer from past 2 years, and even after that they are failing to give proper service. I am surely gonna change my brand, from phone to every small accessories. Nuisance Brand"
It's not working with my redmi note 9promax  I have taken it to oneplus stores they just rest & give back they tell mobile is nit not good u need use this only with oneplus handset. Service people know about this that this headphones is not compatible with many mobile brands and it is not mentioned any very while ordering it they are & they tell it will not working for calling only use it for watching videos. Very bad response..
"This is better than any other in this segment...Most important thing is, I used the earphones for around 11months, n then left side speaker stopped working, so I made a complaint on 'one plus care app' n they picked up my device n returned it after 15 days...but as they couldn't repair it so they sent me a complete new earphone...n this kind of customer support was shocking for me...Please guys don't think too much, jst got for it..."
"Believing in OnePlus brandship I purchased it and ignored other reviews of ""bad battery backup"" about which I totally regret now. They say it can work for 19 hr, I would say it works for 6 hrs Max at midium volume usage. Otherwise sound quality and build quality is very good."
"I started this product using two months ago, I found some problems one month ago.... I found a service centre near me to solve that problem. But in my first visit they told that they have no technicians to solve my problems(i think some covid issues)then I visit after two weeks they checked my product and they told me that the product is ok..... I still find mic is not working properly..... So i request that please help me for this issue..."
Overall I'm happy but somehow I miss the fineness that a 2k earphone should have. But I guarantee you won't notice it untill you are a heavy user of very good earphones. The sound quality is good and upto the mark.
"I have used normal edition of this neck band....were the quality of sound was actually so good...but here oneplus has added little more thing to the bass edition, But which is really affect the overall sound quality.and I can't feel the pleasent bass too.If I use continuously about more than half hour...the sound quality irritates me to take off it..some times in the beginningOther than this everything is so goodBattery is awesomeOverall Built quality is soo good and it worth for what I pay"
"Battery backup nahi he kuch bhi ,4 to 5 hrs,only ,  KDM,Target,U&I so many brand other esse bahot kam rate me he aur battery backup bhi achha aur rate 400 rs.to 500 me best quality wala milta he market me , mere rs.1999. West gaya , original he brand he isiliye purches kiya tha ,battery backup achha hoga  but fail he oneplus z bass edition ,please don't buy this product,"
अमेजोन से मैंने बहुत से प्रोडक्ट खरीदे हैं लेकिन  इस बार मैंने one pluse का ब्लूटूथ मंगवाया जो कि आर्डर से बिल्कुल अलग और डैमेज है इस बार अमेज़न ने मुझे धोखा दिया है  मैने कई बार कस्टमर केयर पर बात की लेकिन उन्होंने रिप्लेसमेंट के लिए लिंक ही नही भेजी
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 it somehow worked for a week and then just not working... it shows red and white light when put on charge and then gone. I bought it as a gift for my father. so disappointed in OnePlus... useless product.. and then even after 1 year of warranty there ways are soooooo complicated to get the device repaired that I would recommend to go for some other brand."
"1 Long battery life but boat 385 v2 defeats it here.2 crystal clear calls3 long range bluetooth connectivity.4 Top notch quick pair5 The thing due to which I love this is 26 g of wait , you can wear whole day during meetings."
"This product only good for listening music..Voice cancellation not good..Redail is not possible, only call attending and stop the call..If redail option is their by pressing pause bottom twice it's good.I was used bolt bluetooth ..It has redail option and I used it by pressing stop/pause button twice on bluetooth headphonesHope the one plus company produce this facility soon..."
"Don't purchase this product as it has very high bass, which is not balanced. So you won't be able to enjoy the original music of song. Also this product is completely useless as for the same price you are getting bullet z2 which has more battery life."
"Connection gets lost automatically after every 20-30 minutes.Can't listen whole movie.Battery backup is good but this thing needs to be rectified.I won't suggest to buy it.Even after paying 2000rs. Result and quality is not upto the mark.First week it worked smoothly from second week , this problem is happening so don't buy this item."
Excellent product. The noise cancellation is average but worth for this price. The voice gets breaking at random times. I don't know if it is a defect of the product I received or a universal issue. Anyway it is much better than the sony neckband I used before which is priced much higher and cannot be used for calls because of the amplification of outer noise.
The ear plug wire is very delicate and the sound quality is really BAD and does not connect to 2 phones as mentioned.Worst af all is the charging does not last for more than 3 Hours.Dont wast you money on this.
The opposite persons can not hear us due to worst noise cancellation...don't go with it ..too much disturbance while call on driving...otherwise normal purpose it's fine
"It was wonderfull product , great sound and clarity , and get charged quickly..i have been using from 3 months....once i charge for 10-15 minutes...it comes for 2 days...Audio quality is very good..."
"I would say this is the best Bluetooth headset for its sound quality and daily use. But the main issue is that, when its battery is low and about to die. It never notifies the user. One wouldn't know how it got switched off as the device does not show any light or voice message signalling Low Battery . Also as this a censor auto on and off, sometimes even when u wear it correctly it is not getting switched on due to censor issue."
"Giving only one star because the after 6 months one side stopped working and after 2 days another side also stopped working. Went to service centre to replace it and they told that please submit it , currently we are running out of stock once it will be available we let you soon and today is 10th days i haven't received any call or text from service centreDon't buy go for any other brand 🙏"
"The product in itself is really good, even compared to other bluetooth earphones, the noise cancelling and the bass is really good, also it stay in your year but doesn't feel like the vacuum effect. Can wear it for as long as you want and as a college student, it works for me for 3 days on a single charge."
"Does the job effectively what it is made for. I was reluctant to use it previously, bought 2 wrong products and then bought these. Excellent help for work from home zoom calls"
"The major con of this product is that it amplifies the noise around you, whether its an air conditioner or noise when you are on road. The person who is on call with you will find it impossible to have a conversation if there is disturbance around you.Moreover, sometimes there is just some repetitive disturbing sound without any outside noise. Wired earphones are much better."
Reasonably price Superb Product. Unmatched performance very much satisfied. BTW this is my 2nd repeat purchased product. So go ahead without any doubt. Also Thanks Amazon for trustworthy experience 👍
"THE EARPHONES HAVE STOPPED WORKING AFTER 52 DAYS OF USE.No charging light and not switching on, even by pressing the buttons or by separating the ear pieces.I need a replacement from OnePlus ASAP. Someone please tell me how caI i do that?The return/ Replacement option is not showing since it has been more than 1 month. PLEASE HELP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE."
I have seen this issue in Oneplus 6t.After using 15 to 20 some time it looses connectivity when we see in bluetooth then its connected but audio is not coming in handfree.So to reseolve this issue i have every time dissconnect the handfree and again connect. Also i have purchase this several time but in every handfree i am facing this issue.
"This is a super priced wireless earphones you can get today, pretty decent sound, the bass is a little on the higher side for a small earphones, so if you're used to balanced sounds , you might use these at 50 to 60% volume and that should do the job! I mainly use it for gaming, and it's super convenient and great battery life! Almost 48 hours of battery life!Definitely recommend!"
Hi EveryoneToday I purchased this One plus bullet Z series Z bass. I want to just convey to all who are reading reviews before buying product which very good habit that this is very good quality bluetooth neck band. Bass is very good and today I come to know that what is noise separation after listening this. I have two other neck band one for me and other for me daughter which is from Noise. But this is ausom. You can definitely purchase this with blind faith.
"There is crackling sound in the background that comes during calls games music anything randomly. During calls, once the crackling starts, it continues. It is known issue with the budsone which got delivered to me @ first had same problem so i went for replacement & yet again same crackling scratchy noise while listening music or watching movies no audio comfort...really disappointed...pathetic buds i ever purchased"
I bought this as a necessity item when my phone mic stopped working and I had switch to speaker to make or receive calls. It has been 8 months now and this is working great. The battery lasts for more than a week on average and that too with extensive use. The voice clarity while making calls is amazing. Buy it without second thought!
"I don't like sound quality .... I use this headphone from 1 month. But this product is only better for  battery life perpose... When I am with call lots of noise are their .. don't buy this product ... .....................................................................,..........,..........,........... It is not economical ... ,2000k is to much ... Go for boat .....................................................I am dissatisfied"
"I used a boult headset before, it could simultaneously connect to two devices-mobile and laptop. However this OnePlus headset can connect to only one at a time. There is a learning curve in using this headset . Overall it's good"
"Overall sound quality is good 👍 & Bass quality is Awesome 🤩 , Some of My personal observations are :-1.It is not suitable for hardcore gamers coz there's a delay in sound while playing games such as BGMI , COD2.It is the best choice for true music lovers3.The build quality is pretty good & the rubber that is used is highly appreciated4.Easy to connect in any smartphones NO APP is required to pairFinally , Great work done by Oneplus👌"
I was assuming that since it's Bass improvised headset the bass would be good if not the best but it's much inferior than the typical boat headsets.. if u r specific about bass then it isn't the great choice. But battery back up is as promised and noise cancellation is perfect.
Don't Buy this product especially if you are fromBhubaneswar. As there is only one service center in Bhubaneswar.Secondly one plus bulet bass edition is a faulty product as went to service center three times in past 7 months regarding various issues no doudt they replaced. But I had to wait 14 days each time.another thing I noticed  everyday around 30 people comes to Service center only for earphone issue. So don't buy this one and please go for other brands.
I have purchased Oneplus Bullets Wireless Z earbuds. But in a week I'm facing connectivity issues with the product. Please replace the same or return the product.Waiting for your response.Thank you.
"I have used the old version of oneplus bullet z (not the bass version), that was perfect.. This one is loud when you play music or watch a video but in call volume is way too low.. I checked my settings it's on full volume yet its very difficult to hear the other person.. I made atleast 10 calls to different people to confirm the issue before posting the review."
The built quality is excellent. You can get a feel from the plastic itself. Also the sound quality is great and noise noise Cancellation is good.The magnet in the earphones is quite strong and is safe to carry around. Battery life is nice. Overall great product and value for money.
Please don't purchase product if you are having any one plus phone above One plus 7 version as the higher version phones has a bug. You will be hearing a static or robotic voice on and off while in a call (WhatsApp /normal/google meet ). Worst Oneplus buy ever.<< PS : Writing this review after replacing the product twice. If in doubt refer the oneplus forum>>
I have used this product before and I have recently bought this product again.It is taking too much time to charge it even after 2 hours it doesn't indicate if it is charged or not.Also battery is draining fast compared to the old version I had before I lost it .. even after 1 year of usage.What happened to OnePlus?Giving quality products is not their focus anymore?
"I bought this headset from you 6 months ago. Worked well all this while but since yesterday, it isn't powering on. Resetting with volume keys isn't working. The device lights up when charging but once unplugged, the light goes off. Is there a solution for this?"
"In one word, you can get headphones like this in Local brand. Audio quality is poor and 0% noise cancellation. Sometimes after connecting device, headphones not working with error device not working properly..... Overall waste product...."
"after 15 days use,often there will be crackling sound.sometimes left earbud sound is gonecannot connect to 2 devices, which any 999/- headphone can.Sound quality not as good as boat headphone worth 1200/-.overall, not a good buy at this price."
I am purchase these bullet bluetooth using for only watching YouTube videos and songs and inka phone calls avariki ayna nenu chesina opposite person voice naku vinipisthundi Kani na voice valaki vinipinchadu and inka nenu purchase chesina 10 days ki am facing these problem and I am visited showroom and no response from show room and no service centre and still I have warranty but no use. Any way is there friends tell me
"Its bass is very bad i dont like it i have Many other headset likeJblSonySkullkandySamsungActually oneplus headset is very badPrice is very highIts not worth When u buy headset please read the customer reviewAm replaced the product second time.Dont waste your moneyTo my dear friends,Prevention is better than cure 🙃🤷🏻‍♂️And am forgot to tellIts made in china 🤣"
I have used 2days while playing the movie and music some times I got cracking noise on the left side and my friends are taken after 2 months they allso facing the same problem. Plz don't at present OnePlus wireless z bass edition and thaks for the Amazon for refund..
"Honestly, I thought this earphones being Just 1,999 would be average. I also had watched few reviews where in it was put up against boat rockerz 233. But I'm actually shocked with the sound quality and build quality. And also, I use a OnePlus phone so connectivity is seamless. You can use play/pause/previous/next track/vol up/vol down and also Google assistant on this. The only issue is it doesn't show indication when it's fully charged. I'm happy and you can go for it."
"Ekdam bakwas product and service, november 21 ko liya hua ye product 3 january 22 ko working karna band hua , customer care ko phone kiya to kehte hai authorised service centre jayiye , no pickup available. Matlab yahase 1000 rs kharch karake service centre jana padega , kya fayada aise service ka . Plz bhai log or bahano ye product mat kharide."
This is the third time i purchased oneplus bullets z Bluetooth earphones but this time i got defective product after 8 days of the use the right ear bud stop working.
"Using since 7 days. Bought mainly for calling purpose. Caller gets my voice clearly even I'm driving two wheeler.1 more thing I'd like add, that when my phone connected to wifi n VoWIFI is on then other headphones fluctuate voice. But oneplus headphone is not that."
"I hated wireless earphones but because of my s20 FE , i had to opt for this option.Main purpose was for calls and have a quality mic , and it does a good job. Battery backup is also good enough. But maybe the current price is a bit on the higher side."
Very ordinary sound.Not good bass.Poor noise cancellation.Don’t feel a sense of immersion I would feel on even a boat product.Learning from this buy: Don’t be deceived by the price not coming down as a sign of quality.
If you talk a lot strongly recommend you to buy this... If you are a music lover don't expect a very good quality of bass and depth.... Charging is very good
"The product is worst when it comes to call. There is a high static noise during calls. Useless if you're buying this for call.There is temporary fix, resetting the headphone and pairing it again. However this works only for few hours. After that again there will be huge static noise.₹2000 is down the drain . Could have bought any other local ones for 500-600.Worst thing , this happens only after the return window is over ."
I bought this for online meetings and eas working fine but after 2 months people at the other end complaints that voice is not clear while using this earphone but when I remove this earphone then they receive a good quality voice. Not served my purpose after spending Rs. 2k on it.
This is the best neckband I've ever usedThis is my fourth OnePlus neckband in a row . These are even better than JBL  earbuds that are thrice of its price.Best value for money product.totally go for it if you are reading this review.sound is such high quality .even over ear premium headphones can't give such sound quality. Very happy customer👍👍
I was facing some problem with it as when i try to increase or decrease its volume a very disturbing sound comes from it and annoys you and later after 2-3 days the sound increased and kept coming in between music also. So i reached the service center and there was a huge line outside it only for the earbuds as everyother person was having the same problem with this product.
"Have been using 365 days, 24x 7 - superb quality and noice cancellation. Best thing - it starts automatically when you seperate both the sides /unmagnet it and shuts when you put them together."
"Product,Quality,Voice,NoiceCancellation Is Good,But The Battery Level is Not as per One Plus Commited, I has to Daily Charge it, Even As per brand they suggest to Charge till 10Minute and we can enjoy till 7Hour but it's can't possible with this,Or I get it the defective piece from Amazon,Anything Would be happen as Brand Commited Wrong or Amazon was gave me defective or replacement Piece"
"Crackling sound in the background during calls, randomly. And once the crackling starts, it continues. I think it's the issue with the buds, and for that you need to reset the device to get it back, and then again the crackling starts in 3-10 hours.And moreover, there's no quick switch button, no forward and backward buttons too...!!!Highly not recommended..."
Before OnePlus earphones I used boat earphone which is better than this in sound quality. OnePlus's offering extra non necessary bass and that also pointy. Not recommending. Go for any other brand. Do not fall for OnePlus brand.
"Bluetooth Earphones are supposed to help in multi-tasking which this does not, it's near to impossible to switch to another paired device, unless you disconnect and switch, the microphone placement is really bad, hides under the collar or hangs way below, Giving 3 stars for good sound quality."
"This was my first try for one plus brand and I’m just surprised with the quality of products they are offering. I recently brought this one plus bullets neckband and I’m just loving it. The product design, sound quality Bluetooth connectivity, Bass, Calling experience, battery performance, everything is just perfect. Pro Gamer may face some latency issue with the neckband but I’m satisfied with the product."
Everything was good until Microphone stopped working in 5months. After that i got replaced from service center again microphone stopped working.. i will suggest go for BOAT price of 1999 is too high for these faulty headphones
1st time i got a product of microphone problem. I thought it was a defective product. Also the original seal was not there and earbuds were missed. I reduced the 1 star for this reason.Recent one I get is a new one .If we pay for new one we should get the new not that old and used product.It is really an unprofessional behavior of seller. 😡😡😡
It is not working at all just after using 2 months I was using it very carefully then also it is showing charging problem and Bluetooth connectivity problem . Even device is not showing in Bluetooth !  There is  charging problem too!
"I purchased the product one week before. Initially it was ok. But after 5 days of use, i noticed voice break and some beep sound while calling. Then i applied for replace. After 5 days i have received  the replaced one and again i tested the call clarity. Unfortunately this item also having the se voice breaking issue. I think, they sended me the same damaged item. I just fed up with this item. Iam applied for the refund and i received the amount yesterday."
"It went well for two months, after that again and again the accommodation is so intermittent, it gets so dirty, it hurts in the ears, bluetooth has to be turned off. Have to turn it on again and again."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Left side not hearingAnd sound also not goodNoo bass at allI did not got replacement and without information delivery associate cancelled my order and attemted the order"
"Somewhere near to good. After using some month it started creating earache as it was felt in last ordered bullet z earphone. Increased noise cancellation and working on this earache issue would be good and would be in favour of customer. The sound quality after somedays went down, noise cancellation is also not much effective."
"Good Quality in All Area ( Sounds quality, noise cancellation, bass etc.) Battery Backup Is better than the Other Company Neckband.There Is One Thing missing i.e. No Option Of Next track and Previous Track Option on The Button Of Neckband."
"I'm giving only 1 star only because of the worst quality of product. I had to change 3 times in warranty period nd last just before warranty going to end is also not working. They are giving worst product again and again. Voice issue. Turing on issue, one side is not working, connecting reconnecting issue. I'm feed up of this product."

 Very poor quality.It worked properly for 15 days now no proper sound, lot of disturbance.It will work only till 10 Days replacement policy❌❌❌❌❌❌"
The ear phones seems to have good audio quality but it starts to give clicks randomly while u listen to music. Which will not go unless you restart your phone. The calls have disturbances sometimes which is annoying. I exchanged my earphones for new one at service center but the issues persist. My phone is redmi k20
This works well with laptop on teams call. Voice is clear and the range is also good. Good for music also. I bought primarily for business calls on teams. I recommend it for teams calls.
"Product is quite nice with premium look and bass punch is very good but the vocals are somewhat not listened Clearly because of punch of bass although it's not so much , second is it's ear rubber bud's which are quite hard not so comfy for long hours that all about it and finally it's Bluetooth connectivity is very fast and impressive."
Battery life is not as expected. Earlier version had the best battery life almost same as advertised but not for this one. I have to charge them every day.Also they removed the dedicated quick switch button.And there's so much noise in the background during calls coming from the headset itself.Gets switched off automatically many a times a day while using.
Today the right side of the earphone stopped working. It did not last for even a year. I had purchased it last may. The quality can be better.
The sound is good for media playing but for calls it is not the right product because while attending the calls a buzz kind of disturbance sound is encountered all the time by which i have to shift to mobile speaker. The reason of buying this device is to attend the calls which is not satisfied. I want amazon to return back my money or else replace the item with the new one
"Appreciated it most for call quality. Connectivity is great with any BT device (tv, laptop, phone). It’s an average experience for music nothing too great, nothing less. Has decent quality with an added bass.What I miss is a quick switch button to toggle between paired devices."
My first experience with a One Plus product and it is very positive. Happy with this purchase. Build quality is better than average. Sound quality is fine. I use it for mainly for calls. Do not expect too much noise cancellation either.
"Just over a month and microphone because dumb, other person cannot hear a thing, even though earphones looks good outside, it is having too many technical anomalies in long term use. Couldn't even find proper warranty, didn't expect this from one plus product. Disappointed. One plus, help me in warranty, you guys making it so hard intentionally to apply for warranty."
"Bass is good but it is not acceptable by a esteemed brand by saying that, bass edition has quick switch mode and not giving it. It is not acceptable from reputed brand. Other wise sound quality, noise cancellation and bass quality is great"
Should not be available for other users who does not use OnePlus...sounds pathetic...In calls the other one can't hear my voice properly...Bass is on paper not in the headphones... Battery back-up is good...but what's the point without the sound quality...
"Sony WI - C 400, MI earphones are much better than this earphones. Got faulty first time, got it replaced. Still sound quality, voice clarity is bit bad.The best price for this would be 500rs ."
You can listen to music on decent volume but over a call this earphone is pathetic. I returned it the first time assuming must be some Internal issue but again I received same defected piece of frustration. I had received a lot lf good reviews personally because of battery life which is really nice but I don't understand what the problem is and I just want to throw this away when I'm over a call. Pathetic
"Not a value for money average sound quality.  I have did very detailed comparison between boat rokerz 255 pro + and this and found that one is best value for money and sound quality is almost identical, mic is quality is slightly better In oplus, very minute. But battery backup is really vast. 35 vs 15 hrs in Op"
"It's comfortable to wear,Easy to connect with Bluetooth.Good built quality.If you listen for long time, maybe harmful as noise cancellation is not that good compared to my Sony headset.Bass quality can be improved.Good buy at this price range"
"HiiI am facing an issue. I use the oneplus bullets wireless z with my realme 8 5g. i have faced an issue since the beginning, online calls either voice or video (Whatsapp, Totok, Zoom, Messenger) do not work at all.If i have started a video call, it works perfectly, but as soon as i connect the earphones, it displays connectivity issues and just doesn't work."
The Volume control switch came off and fell somewhere within 6 months of usage. Poor quality.. Very disaappointed.. Other than that the sound effects are pretty good. But the product lasts for just 6 months at this price range is not acceptable.
"The sound quality is good, but the mic is not upto the mark, sometimes people can't here my voice in call then i need to swith off bluetooth and take call, it is not supporting some apps like instagram, Facebook while in call, we cant play reels while in call, whereas all other headphones i used support this feature, the battery performance is 14-15 hrs where company claim 17hrs at 60% volume"
"The headphones are awesome and keeps the OnePlus legacy alive. Though I am having issues while using the headphones with my mi 11x 5G.So an advice to those who are planning to purchase, use it with OnePlus only."
That I have been used only 3 month and become error not working. Starting was very quit impressive even I thought Oneplus is everything compared with other but not. I was maintained very useful but unfortunately Oneplus heart hurtme because If I'm in home than I can adjust but I'm far of my city very difficult to buy.
"Not working properly, gets disconnected after each call. Request support team to connect.It is as if some kind of a bug, that allows the device to get disconnect. Sometimes, we are on call, and audio switches to the phone, which is not only irritating but quality wise also bad!"
Looking at this price range it has the best sound quality material is very durable and the charging speed and battery is just awesome
Sound quality was amazing but durability is the issue … it stopped working after 4 months and no dedicated customer service centre of one plus in Bangalore.. it’s still under warranty but don’t know how to get it repaired. No support from Amazon on this kinda issues .. did wrong thing by buying from Amazon
"When compared to the previous model, this is a bit low inbuilt quality and also as the mic piece is adjoined with the main part, it would be difficult if you are using while RIDING or travelling in a public transport; as the person in the other end won’t be able to hear you properly."
Everything is best with this device.. Just neckband firmness and length lacking...Rest. Audio quality is awesome...Battery womt last either for 17 hr... But ok...Genuine feedback...  Go for it..
"First few days it was working fine but suddenly a crackling sound started, especially in laptop, it's very irritating. Also, all of sudden the volume turns down, microphone doesn't work, it doesn't restart.It's only been a month and almost everyday I face some of these problems .Okayish quality.Not worth the money."
Very effective for hands free option for one plus mobile. Good sound quality. Easy to use and excellent sound quality.
"PUBG walo... Mat loo iise... Dur hi raho... Sound ka bohot issue hai... Koi bhi 400/500 ka earphone lelo agar sirf PUBG hi khelna hai to...Not recommend for base user... Sound is just as good as 600 rs of wired earphone, nothing is too special about sound quality.I would recommend Boat rockers 335 over this one blindly & any 400 RS of earphone for PUBG saves money..."
"Surprised with it's built quality and battery life.Only one issue, the buds doesn't fit correctly in ears,take time to get used to it."
No quickswitch button. It's a pain to connect this to my work laptop and mobile.Quality has gone down for Oneplus.Oneplus no more. I should have seen the reviews before buying. I blindly trusted the brand.😂 Jokes on me.
Every time i answer call from my iphone i need to connect again to speak through it..it also happens that it automatically gets disconnected on call..i dont know about android but this is happening with my i phone..i tried with another iphone it is still getting disconnected..kindly take back this product
As claimed in product description charging for just 10 minutes well that isn't true. My product is taking up to an hour to get charged and just in 1 month this is the condition. I cannot return it now as according to return policy i can return it just within 10 days. Otherwise sound quality is good but I personally wouldn't recommend it. It is not worth spending Rs 2000. I would recommend boat than oneplus.
"Right side stopped working after 2 months of daily usage. For such a cheap price I expected that it will last for around 6 months, but it hardly lasted for 40-50 days.OnePlus will not replace / repair this since they provide warranty ONLY for products bought from their website, and not on Amazon. Keep this in mind before purchasing."
They do not support Quick switch like wireless z version. It's falsely claimed that this support quick switch. I bought this bass edition on review of normal wireless z but these are not good. Battery time is less. I am facing issue of call drop as well. Earphones automatically disconnect while on a call. Searched it on google and this could be manufacturing defect.
Waste of money with in 6 month one side it is stopped working even service centre people is not exchanging always saying product is out of stock overall this OnePlus earphone is very bad.
"There is so much complications while connecting two devicesAs compared to boat rockerz ... those are very easily switched between two devicesSo if you use two devices, this is not such a good productEvery time you have to connect from one device then connect to another"
OnePlus has cheated by declaring Quick switch option. Actually it doesn't have. Older version of Bullets had it. No return Option as well to force customer to keep this waste item.My recommendation to everyone is don't buy this. Search for a better one.
It don't work properly on AAC codec but work fine on SBC codecDon't buy if you are iphone user because you can't change bluetooth codec in ios it doesnt sound clear in ios a cracking sound is continuously heard.I replaced the earphones twice but it has same problemThe earlier version was perfectly working on iosVery disappointed by oneplus.
It is not working Huawei mate 10 lite .It is not working with Remi 6.Other bluetooth earphones work with above mention phones.It is working with Samsung so I have given this to my younger brother.It has no return policy but replacement policy. Feels like cheated.
I use it primarily for office calls on laptop. Audio quality to me and other party is fantastic. WhatsApp call quality is also great. Go for it.
"Battery backup is good, pairs very quick with OP mobiles( Not used with other mobile so can't say about that). Sound quality is also good. After 3 months of uses no issues. Bought it based on real reviews...not online reviews. Don't regret the decision."
The product that I have purchased for your site .I think that it will good in Quality but it was not good the sound that I want to hear it was in low quality and the charging is also not nice not good so my request is to you please carry it from my home as soon as it possible and refund my money so I can buy another product .It my request to you.
"While on going call opposite person cannot hear voice. Bought an expensive product thinking the quality must be good, but received a defective and poor quality product. Purpose is not solved. Unhappy with the product. Cannot buy or suggest to buy this product."
यह एक बेकार प्रोडक्ट है.... इसमें कॉल पर बात करते समय आवाज कट होती है जिस से आप को ठीक से सामने वाले की बात सुनाई नहीं देती...और आपकी भी आवाज ठीक से नही जाती....इस प्रोडक्ट को लेना टोटल पैसे की बर्बादी है.... केवल नाम पर न जाए....इसमें नॉइस कैंसलेक्शन का भी फीचर नहीं है इस से सस्ते दाम पर इस से ज्यादा फीचर वाले ब्लूटूथ मार्केट में उपलब्ध हैं
Have been looking for good bluetooth headphones for music and this serves the purpose. Its sleek and good features. Can be used for Voice call  as well as the mic is really good
"Terrible - voice distorts when increasing or decreasing volume .NO DUAL PAIR. I called the oneplus tsore they confirmed that this model dors not have the quick switch unlike it being mentioned here . You have to go bluetooth settings and switch from one device to another.Buy the older version it has higher battery life , quick switch button and better in every way possible."

 One plus service center madhapur , said that we don't have any water proof productAnd my blotooth is not working properlyThan why should upload  fake information in sale point  totally worst service , worst response"
Very bad product...when connected to my one plus phone for calls there's always a lot of disturbance and static and i invariably have to disconnect the headphone. Defeats the purpose of the headphones...It needs to be fixed or replaced. Someone from the company pls help resolve this
"Sound quality & battery back, bass etc is good but when connecting other devices we face issue as well as while talking on call other person doesn't able to listen us. It's noise cancellation & call quality doesn't work properly. For listening music it's good but for talking on call it's worse."
"- best design,- great clarity of sound & awesome bassDon’t compromise by buying cheaper headsets. This is the iconic product for Bluetooth headsets."
"I would definitely recommend this product if your preference is calls. The battery back up is truly amazing! Lasts an entire day with a single charge.  Don’t expect too much bass. Doesn’t have noise cancellation. You will be heard crystal clear on calls. I spend 3 to 4 hours on calls on a daily basis, absolutely no complaints."
Oneplus wireless headset is goodly for usage and also in the time of sweating as isage was very good but noise canceling is not sure good it's just okay.....bass and sound and other things was good in one plus z wireless headset......!
It is good product. It takes only 8-10 min full charging and use for full day. You can buy. It is also water resistant. Can connect to any mobile.
The only thing good about this headphone is it's battery life.The without bass edition is way better than this. Don't know why the company discontinued that.
It is completely not expected from Oneplus. I have been using one plus from 5 yrs back and upgrading my phone on yearly basis. This one I feel so cheated from So cAlled one plus brand no quick switch option to switch between mobile and laptop. Worst one do not buy this
The price  is not justified for the quality if sound and noise cancellation ability. Should be prices less than 1000
Genuine review after one month of use . I seriously disappointed with this one plus earphone I bought three timesand returned it three times. Don't waste your money even a single rupee on this earphone is waste of money. There's a crackling sound in the background which never stops.
"It's really a very good product from Amazon for both mobile and laptop good for calls mics are excellent and for music it's awesome. In a single charge it will go a day in normal use.Sound quality is very good, noise cancellation is good and bass quality is best😘."
सर मुझे डिलीवर किया गया प्रोडक्ट खाली निकल गया और अब वह प्रोडक्ट अट्ठारह ₹100 का ही आ रहा है मुझे मेरे पैसे वापस दे दो मुझे नहीं चाहिए आपकी कंपनी से कोई प्रोडक्ट क्योंकि शुरू में डिफरेंट कलर प्रोडक्ट बो  2 दिन लेट पहुंचाया और दूसरी बार तो खाली डिब्बा ही मिला है सर प्लीज मेरे पैसे वापस लौटा दो मुझे नहीं चाहिए आपकी कंपनी से कोई भी चीज
"One of the best product. I love using it, good for music, online zoom meeting and regular voice calls. Light weight and quick connectivity, buy this product without any hesitation."
"Right side audio quality is very low. and much noise sound it was not as per expected. bass quality is very poor it's only on title but not in product. sound quality like mono. when you up down volume you can here cracking voice.I got used product, product box was already unboxing."
"I have been using different products in search of quality then I came across this awesome shtt.. It provides you best bass,clear audio, epic surround effect, and virtualization.... No one can compete this.... And my it got stretched once and then one side was gone... Then Onplus warrenty just gave me a new one"
"These earphones are a scam.The battery doesn’t even last a full day of normal use, let alone get close to 20hrs as claimed.I am stuck with them because I got them to the UK with me. I curse the day I ordered them. Waste of money and time. Shameful from OnePlus"
Pros1. Superb Build Quality. Sturdy Design.2. Awesome Bass.3. Not missing Quick Switch Feature from Old OP.4. Best Call Quality so far. Noise cancelling is not selling point for this earphones.ConsNothing as Such. Just go for it. I bought this with 2K.
Don't know why people go for ear buds I tried 2-3 products but they are not good notice cancellation problem is high fitting in ear is a issueSo go for this type
Good company like OnePlus haven't done anything about this problem is just unacceptable. Whenever you call somebody there is noise in both caller and receiver's end. I don't know if this problem is only with OnePlus 7 pro or with any other devices. I hope this issue will be resolved ASAP.
"Mic doesn't work. Tried it with multiple devices, still no luck. Apparently a lot of people are facing the same issue, still OnePlus has not official guide to fix it. No quick switch button. And the way in which they say we can switch between devices doesn't work 90% of the time."
"I was a Oneplus fan. But this one is an average product, You will get much more quality products with this price range. It doesn’t have noise cancellation and also poor mic quality, you have to put it over the mouth for clear audio calling."
"I like the band, but it is not 100% comfort, the battery backup was great. 10minutes charging on 30w charger get 12 hours battery life in half leval volume."
"Disappointed with the purchase! The earpiece is designed pathetically, doesn't fit right!! N if earpiece don't fit then what's the use of having earphones 🙄"
"There is crackling sound in the background that comes during calls games music anything randomly. During calls, once the crackling starts, it continues."
The audio quality is nice but it gives a cracking sound after some time which is really disturbing so I had to replace the earphones. Bit the problem continued in replaced item too. Also the volume buttons started making the same sound when pressed!! Never expected these basic problems from brand like OnePlus!!!
"This is the my  second time to returning this Bluetooth because , having mic issue in this Bluetooth, very worst quality ..The person in front of me , he cannot hear my voice  clearly .....i am a big fan of one plus, i used one plus bullets wireless whis was 3999rs which was superb quality but this one is worst."
"Guys, please check policy before buying. They are trapping customers by selling bad quality product.  The product is ever worst than 599 headphone PTron which I brought.Please keep away from oneplus brand. I should have noticed no return policy, because means theya are not confident of their product"
"This is really one of the perfect earphone at this price range. It has a good base quality which you might be find quite less in compare to some Boult's earphones but except this quality the rest of other things are really benchmark at this price range. Sound quality is good and very balance. Calling quality is also very very good, look and build material is good."
Best for travel and home use. Bass is not upto the notch. But you cannot get this battery life in anyother headphoneas. I would use it for one full day(24hrs) with one time full charge(calls and music) and 5hrs with 10-15min fast charge.
"I am really happy with the performance.... It is an amazing device having amazing Bass and equally good Mid and Treble .... Therefore, I consider this device very balanced and delight for any audiophile .... Bluetooth connectivity with Phone or any other device is very smooth and quick .... I hope company will also incorporate other upgraded features and may come up with a new model ...."
10 minute charge gets me going for a day easily. ~ 6 hrs use. Quality of sound is also good. Slightly expensive but product quality ensures you don't complain about the extra price
"Everything is fine, sound clarity, Bass, battery back up is also good, especially the magnetic fields on the back of the bullet type ear piece which plays very good role for long battery life, which cut off from the phone if we stick to each other and immediately connects as.soon as we detatch. One thing I would like to say the noise cancellation is not good."
Pros:1. Packaging.2. Bass & Sound.3. Light weight.4. Comfortable while using in ears.5. Noise cancellation.6. Using one plus Dash charger battery got charged 100% from 20% in 25 minutes.
This is a absolutely wonderful product. We the mid range customer have not had the guts to buy a headphone of  Rs 25000/ . This has fullfill the taste of hearing good sound. Believe me its good and worth buying. Will review it after using of 1 or 2 months. I think it will stands tall.
This headphone is tremendously amazing if you are looking to use it everysingle day. I use this all the time its fab and durable. The charging time is just 10 mins it will be ready to use again. This does gets damaged after an year or so(I kniw this because this is my second purchase) Go ahead and buy.
Volume is very very bad and product is very poor condition and request krta hu ki kisi bhii customer ki jab Mt Kato customer ko proper way me product do and soo first check the product in delivery timing soo better soo team se ek he baat bolna chahta hu ki es headphone ka solution kre Amazon team that solve
"Regret buying, as it discharges even on standby. Have to keep charging often. Not useful for office/business use. No great music quality."
Battery backup is not good i am using approx 3-4 hour daily and 100 to 0% take 3 days so approx 100 to 0 took 10-12 hours
I ordered this after so many of positive reviews but with in seven days one ear bud is not working. Highly disappointed. Wastr product
"It creates extra background sound. Which personally irritates me a lot.Noise cancellation is better than its normal edition.If this types of background irritating sound is called Bass, I don't like ""Bass"".Go for its normal edition if you like balanced sound and quality based sound.Normal edition has also a better battery life."
"The beauty is that once this is paired & connected, it can resume connection as soon as you put the ear speakers into your ears."
Earphones are excellent. I'm charging once in two days.. even with heavy use. And charging it is easier than a charging a mobile.
Please Don't buy this ...Bad quality of product build quality ..My volume key cover lost while driving ...It is not much stronger as I expected... Please don't try one pluse ..And I come to service center they dineid ..To take back ..So try other brand cause ..They don't serious about coustemer satisfaction..
"Unfortunately, I didn't do enough research, but if you are reading this - Stay away from these headphones if you want to use it to take calls. Barely 2 weeks and people can hear static when I speak.The only good feature is the magnetic autoconnect but you can find the same feature in a cheaper headphones."
"This earphones are best in sount but when I see any video there is a buzzing noise in background. I have tried resetting earphones, removing phone cache, etc. But issue is still there. I hope this is helpful."
"Bought it in sep 2021.no doubt it was working fine .since yesterday, mic stopped  functioning. Ear price are still working fine.m using it while watching OTT series but unable to communicate during calls .What's the procedure to claim warranty.."
"Not at all satisfied, if you use this continuous for 1 hour than your ears will start paining and lead to infection in ears. Can seller please let me know whether there is manufacturing defect or quality is like this only?"
"One plus earphones are awesome, different from any other because of their sound quality. One of friend suggest me these earphones as he is using since last more than 1 year & he didn't face any problem upto now. These one plus earphone are best among all that I used in last 5-6years."
"After six month usage, best Bluetooth headset I ever used, comfortable nice build quality excellent sound quality"
The headsets have become garbage for me in just 9 months. One day it was working and then suddenly the headset stopped connecting to my phone. I tried almost everything but it doesn’t even pair now. No issues about the sound quality but built could have been better
Device is fine also sounds good but i got microphone issues in this device and oneplus is not replacing i want to tell everyone that audio devices are not repairable as per company policy & company always give replacement in case if u get any issues with your audio devices
"Crackling sound while hearing songs, and Bluetooth got disconnected often when there is a call, when switching between Bluetooth devices From your mobile it doesn't connect back. Wasted money on this. If someone interested in buying OnePlus bullets z bass edition, don't do it. Go for realme buds wireless Neo 2"
The product is good but not worth for 2k..Noise cancelation is not working in this earphone.  100rs earphone is better than this when it comes to noise cancellation...While calling the voice is not coming in crystal clarity.. exactly it worth for 700rs that's it other 1300rs is for oneplus brand not for earphone
"I am a music lover,as per my opinion this is Awesome Bluetooth,Sound Quality,bass, battery  backup all things are Superb"
Got a brand new piece (that’s always my major concern). Glad got it over Amazon than OnePlus as it’s more convenient. Got a good piece!
Do not buy if you don't have bluetooth 5.0v trust me it will give lot of issues if bluetooth version is below 5.0 and you can not return it once you buy it will be replaced and same thing happens again.
There is a weird distortion sound between calls because of which i have to disconnect the devcie again and again to reconnect when ever it happens .
"Anyone takes Bluetooth(Neck band) from this company(One plus) , first of all I wish to know that if you have a mobile of Mi (Xiaomi) , then do not take it because in the beginning the sound comes right but later unwanted noise (rattle) starts coming and on going to the service center refuse to replace."
When we compare to old 1+ z wire is very thin charging time is little more magnet is half stronger than old bass is little bit more than old otherwise quality is very less and the same price 2k dnt know abt durability...truly business
Far better than other ones I used long lasting battery is a big plus. Bass is ok can be used to make and receive calls in traffic also. Thanks Amazon
"I missed the return window on this item. But right now, it's neither getting charged, not working. There's a weird rain noise continuously coming out of the buds even though it's not connected to any device."
"Bass quality, sound quality, noise cancellation everything is good. 5 seconds muted on every songs while am hearing in every minute. I can't use with live events. I thought this bug in YouTube. Later i analyse this bug in headphones after using amazon prime, YouTube and other apps. Pls let me know, how can i solve this bug?"
"Whenever I pause the music/video, it’s keep on disconnecting and connecting. Most of the times when I play the music again after a gap, it will be in disconnected state. Very irritating."
Excellent edition compared to cost. Superior quality and very essential for daily use but missing quick switching mode which was available in the previous edition
This is the most unexpected delivery I get from Amazon.I ordered black OnePlus earphones but in box I get the red one and those are also damaged and not working.I want to return this product as soon as possible.I hope this mistake won't happen again from Amazon.
After 1 week of usageWorth to buy for 2k.1. Sound quality (bass)2. Comfortable while using3. Easy to access4. Charging for 10minutes you can watch one movi  Oneplus other than smartphone users can buy this headset.
The headphone did not work within two months of purchase. I'm used this headphones two months only.. I booked a complaint on OnePlus care.. they get it back to service center 14 days before.. still there is no information about my headphones.. really worst service oneplus.. don't buy this.. my total money is waste..
Backup is good. Sound quality is not bad. As per my requirement I need some more clear / clean sound. Bass is good not to say Z Bass. Its like ordinary neck bands which we get in below / near about 1000 rupees. I am disappointed after buing this product. Please go with Sony or other branded neckbands.

 Product bahut accha h. Beshak aap ise le skte h....ye ek sath do system ke sath bhi pair kiya ja skta h. Phone connectivity bhi bahut acchi h. Full paisa vasool Product h....👍👍"
Using it continuouslyGood sound quality .. call quality and battery...Cheap and best ... no issues observed...just buy ... no other headphone matches the quality of these
First thing is the earphones doesn't turn on at all . It shows light while charging but doesn't turn on .and secondly the product seems old and damaged and one of its side wire at the insertion of the earphone is partially cut . And moreover there are items missing in the package as there was no user manual and only one pair of extra ear pieces
After 2 months of use i missed volume up down buttons...  And their is crackling voice comes when song and video is played...In winter season their is problem of connection of mobile to headphone Bluetooth....If you want high bass then dont go for it..Only hypes is their and avarage bass...
I was not sure about  the product after reading few negative reviews here but decided to give it a shot and I am happy with this.
First time I ordered this product but one side speaker is not worked so I returned and then order second time. After 6th day the volume is decreasing automatically to 0. By yesterday itself I raised but returning policy is not available. So don't buy this product by online. It's totally fake.
I gifted this one of my friend and it's been almost half a year still it's like a new and no problems faced till now and sounds great with a decent bluetooth range
Right side earphone is not working properly. I have returned the first that i bought but again they re sent the product. Still im facing the same problem.
Mic stopped working after 10 days. Service provided by the oneplus care is really frustrating. They held the device over a month. I still not receive the device from service center. Hope they make it work well.My suggestion is not to buy this instead you go for boat or samsung level1 etc.

 Cool packaging. The band is solid yet quite flexible. Bluetooth connectivity is superb. Charging fast.Sound quality is good.Cons- no cover/cap on charging slot.Looks and color are average."
"After using 2 months I wrote the review quality is good but after two months there is lots of problems comes it's doesn't take charge and also not connected with mobile ,so if you want to buy this doesn't buy Amazon/Flipkart just go directly to shop they given 1 year warranty . It's good Thanku"
"No noise cancellation, decent sound quality, and no bass whatsoever. Can't be used for long hours."
Pros- Overall the experience is good.However couple of cons.1. It takes way too much time for a new device to get connected.2. Noise cancellation is partial. Not much effective.3. Battery back up is not up to the mark.
"I purchased this ear phone a few days back. Initially, the sound quality was very good. However, after using it for some time, I get some crackling sound. Not so good to listen to now."
"No doubt this has best sound quality but the worse things are battery, no codec, no switching button.Hence we better to switch to another brand"
"I was wondering when it failed to connect with Phone, it's not working after 10 days. I don't know what is the use of company product that we use  it's totally waste of money Rs/1799.i was really disappointed with the product .I was trying to return but return window is closed .I don't know what to do now."
After using for a month a cracking sound during calls has started … there is connectivity issue … sound while calls gets cracking after some time of call .
Worst ekdum bekar Puri voice earphones ke bahar aati hai at High volumeEk saal pahle bhi liya tha but that was amazing this time just like local earphones not brandedAnd return karne me bhi selected option hai or un options me select karke return bhi nhi ho rha
Middle button of the earphone ( used to play the next or previous song ) is not working .Trying to find a way to claim the warranty and to return it but not seeing any option to do so . Not even to talk to the customer care..
This new model is completely garbage. Audio keeps on disconnecting while video goes on. I thought mine was defective and replaced but new one also had same issue. Don't buy. Also all good reviews and stars are for the old model. Amazon just included them in this new one. -5 star from me.
Only 15 days I used it.. after that I m trying to get service but unfortunately I didn't get yet.
Battery life: GoodStyle : MediumBluetooth settings : ExcellentSound effects: PerfectValue for money ? :  Absolutely!!!!!
"I heve order many no. Of this product . Everyone is exchanched men two times due to any problem in neckband , like sound , like one earpiece is working , like disconnection problem"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Its been only 6 months that I have taken this product and one side is stopped workingI have warranty want money back or replacement"
"Sound quality is Ok! Not great compared to sony, Soundpeats, Jabra , Soundcore etc. Its more Warm sounding and Not an Open experience. Not Recommendable to Audiophiles. But for the Price its Great. Has good specs too (backup, Charging speed etc)"
This definitely is a little expensive as compared to others but the sound and quality is out of the world.Sound quality : 9/10Sturdiness : 9/10
"With in 20 days it stopped working, as I have not used much ..  I have a lot of trust in this brand but from now onwards I will not buy. Please do not buy ... 😡"

 Very very bad experience from Amazon ,i didn't expect from Amazon , I ordered OnePlus wireless z bass edition but got old model damaged product totally disappointed it doesn't work , product package already teared inside the courier box"
"Bahut saari problems hai iss model me.Na to call quality thik hai,na hi sound quality.Microphone cheaper quality ki hai,thodi si piche jaane pr sound bahut hi km ho jaata hai call pr..."
"Sound quality is good, need to work on noice cancellation and when we want the bass it should sync properly , otherwise it will not give clear sound"
This headphones produces cracking sound and it feels very cheap. I'm using honor phone and facing this with this brand new earphones from day one. Don't blindly go with YouTube reviews. How's that sound? - It is similar sound as if any wired headphones connector moves in middle of songs. Cracking!
There is no noise cancellation.sometimes while calling Bluetooth connection will disconnect. We cannot answer what's app call by Bluetooth. If we are in WhatsApp call and we get any call on sim Bluetooth connection will automatically disconnect ( pick up or not)  and need to connect manually.
In 5th aug 2021 buyed. But in 1st May 2022 is not worked. I placed repair option through OnePlus help app and I got new replacement of one plus headphone neckband on 9 May 2022 and Thanks OnePlus
"Product quality is awesomeBattery has jumping percentage, it will show 60 % and in no time it Will be 20%Bass is ok.Volume is loud"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Don't buy this one plus bluetooth Bullet z because call drop issues we are facing wrost services"
Amazing sound qualityLong battery lifeAutomatically connect & disconnectPremium qualityWorth for every penny
"Update after 1 month of use.There is crackling sound in the background that comes during calls games music anything randomly. During calls, once the crackling starts, it continues. It is known issue with the buds, and you need to reset the device to get it back, and then again the crackling starts in 3-10 hours."
"There is a static noise that remains for little bit of time, whenever you use it and the bass gets a little high the voice starts to break. Also it sometimes disconnects automatically from time to time, the one plus bullets Z normal edition is much much better than this."
"So far so good.Good choice under 2k.pro's: sound quality good. comfortable, mic quality no compliments yet. battery good. type-c charger cable, Bluetooth 5 connectivity. build quality good.cons: No issues were noticed."
"Difficult in blue tooth connecting, if lucky it will connect, or cannot use, after some times, it connect automatically..Not good product, waste for 1999.00 rs..Once connected. it will work..Today 29.09.2021, could not connect, in office, since morning trying.. mental torture."
I have used both type of earphones the normal one and the bass variant. The normal earphone was good compare to bass variant. The bass variant earphone price is high battery quality is not upto price and the sound is ok. I have written the review after using 4months of product
"For Warranty service center asking box, I don't ve box they r not accepting without box it's 25days only when bought it stopped working not charging n not switching on"
I had taken this product months back. And now the voice calling is an issue. There's a cracking voice in the calls which is disturbing. The music can be listened properly. No help from the OEM
"am giving this review after using 4 days... the sound quality is good.. for listening songs you can you can take.. while riding a bike in highway and you are in a call, recevier cant hear your voice,they will here only air sound, noise cancellation is very poor..."
I bought it 6 months ago and now the left ear phone is not working. No sound from the left ear phone. Hope it covers in 1 year warranty.
Major cons is while you talk with someone you get cracking sound.. it is very annoying and otherbend user get broken vpice from you. Very bad product to be precise. At first i thought that this is manufacturing problem so i replaced it but in new product same problem persist so i am returning the item.
"One plus has made a very good headphone good fit, awsome sound quality and moderate to good telephone conversation"
Connection drops every few minutes. The problem gets worse as days go by. I have a piece which is less than a couple of months old. It is paired to an OnePlus 7 pro. I can't even watch a 90 minutes movie without the audio dropping some 10 times in between. Oneplus is not what it used to be.
"OnePlus is ever made  premium quality products and one of them is this neckband. Sound,base and noise is awesome in this ear buds,but when I played game in my mobile then  the more latency in this neckband.This is the weakest point in this neckband."
"Just after a month of receiving these earphones, there was a static buzzing sound when on call. The people on the other end couldn't talk to me cause of the noise which was much more prominent than my voice. It's the worst product that I've ever purchased from Amazon. I normally don't write good/bad reviews but this forced me to"
"Died in the middle of a call after barely a month of use. Won't switch on now. No damage whatsoever.EDIT: The earphones resumed working after a few attempts of trying. Still, don't like the fact that they had to die on me unexpectedly."
Very easily paired with Android phone. Very less battery consumption.charging time is very less. Purchase without any hesitation.original nice packing.
I bought this on 11 may 2021 and now after completing 1 year it stopped working.  No physical wear tear are there. Out of warranty so became useless. Very bad experience at least 2 year support must be given for such expensive earphone.
This is the Best Buy for a Bluetooth headphone neckband. No other product comes close to this. Magnificent!!!
Good product with this price range. Sound quality & performance is awesome...thanks....🙏🙏🙏
"I hate the battery life so disgusting.i am writing this review after using it fr almost a month,god only knows what is draining the battery this much i use only after my work hours that too"
After 3 days it stopped working. I am not able to find any option for replacement
"Battery life commendable, sound quality and noise cancellation are amazing. Resistance to sweat and water is another plus."
"Pros :Sound quality is best.Battery life is Maximum.Bass volume is good, differs while riding a bike.Magnetic turn on and off.Cons :I'm using since 5+ months, if you're new user then your ear starts paining."
Good Quality Bluetooth.  Responsive and durable. Only issue I had is the magnet switch which is turning off the Bluetooth when out of your ear while hanging. So need to have it in your ear always even when not in use
Perfect fit to ear and sound also good. On off control in magnetic earpiece is plus for this headphone. Quality also good. Deliverd within 2 days thats great.
Sound quality and bass quality is ok but product lasted for only 4 months which is bad in case of a brand like this and replacement was also very difficult i visited store also but they said server issues and took me 3 days just to replace this useless product
Very bad Bluetooth earphone .Do not buy it otherwise your 💰 will waste.For 1 week it was good 😊 but after some time was waste.Same condition was of my friend.You can buy Sony or other brands but do not buy this earphone.Thank You 😊💞
My earphones stop working in between anytime.They work again only after attaching and removing their magnets.
"This one didn't last a month, there is lot of interruption in Bluetooth connectivity and ko clear voice on calls."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Give me a defected product bt after return again give defected product product ..after that Amazon was  not return product nd in their app it shows that item return already...if possible the help me regarding this."
"The sound quality is Ok, the extra bass that they promise, seemed like they just increased the volume of everything which kind of compromised with the sound quality at higher volumes.Performance, connectivity and portability are all good.For Sound quality just because it had a zz sound at higher volumes i would give it 3/5"
One side doesn't work and One plus replacement procedure is the worst. I have been waiting for 2 months to get it replaced. Visited the store 2 times. Once they did not accept and once they were busy selling the new product so they asked me to come again
"PRODUCT CLAIM OF NOISE CANCELLATION... NT THERE. AT THIS PRICE, IF NOISE CANCELLATION IS MISSING... PRODUCT NEEDS 2 B RETURNED, NT REPLACED. PL ARRANGE FOR RETURN & REFUND, WUD LIKE 2 BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT"
Initially when I charged the earphone it get turned on and was working but day by day it was getting defected and now it is not turning on even after charging. It is thw first time I got a defective item from amazon which was not expected. I want to replace my item. @amazon kindly do the needful. This is not expected at all.
Good sound quality ( not the best though )It could have been better. But it's very good for this price range. I'd recommend it!
don't waste your hard earned money on this faltu product. I bought received this product on Thursday and today is Sunday and I m hardly use this airphone just 2or 3 hours whenever I tried to use it always in discharged condition..poor battery life very poor.
"Yes very Good Product &battery🔋 life n very goodfast charging,Only 10 -15 minutes charging time is requiredC-Type charging,"
Been a constant fam of OnePlus products but this one dissapoints. There is constant noise and voice is heard robotic on either side during calls from this earphone. Thought maybe defect with particular set but the exchanged one turned out same. These robotic voice issue is constant and too irritating.
"Excellent Sound quality, Ease of connectivity and good range of Bluetooth. Even at near full volume you can enjoy thumping sound without hurting your ears and the persons around you won't be able to listen even slight of the sound."

"Bought this second time, used Daily while workGood quality product, battery life and sound bass qaulity, sometime get automatically disconnected on callOverall value for money with good sound"
I have been struggling with earphones for a while. Finally got these a while back. The battery life is pretty good. Once I am done using I can just attach it with magnet and its turned off. It connects to the device immediately when I detach it. The sound is really good and the mic is pretty good too. Loved it.
"This is not at all suitable for a person who roams outside, the previos model with seperate mic was better compared to this,. This is suitable only for a person who works within office."
"This is an amazing product by OnePlus! The Bass quality is not bad. If you are an EDM music lover, you should definitely go for this...the one drawback of this Oneplus bullets wireless Z bass edition is it's Battery life, overall the product is fantastic!!"
1. Battery backup awsome2. Good quality3. Sound quality supply4. Worth 1999 rupees in this product
Within a month right earplug stopped working. Now can hear the music from left earplugs only right one stopped working.Worst product ever from OnePlus. As service centers are limited only there is no service center near my hometown. So much disappointment from this product.
Clearly suggests to anyone that don't purchage one plus because it's only the wastage of money...bass quality is not good....
It's only been a month since I bought this earphone on the great indian sale and it was working just fine until yesterday it suddenly stopped working. I tried charging it and holding buttons continuously and nothing ever worked. This is so bad on oneplus's part and I'm trying to get a replacement.
"Pros: withstands charge as committed, Clarity in voice and fits the neck perfect.Cons; Switch not available. If it had been, pure bliss for WFH"
"Did a lot of research it is really best in this price segment. super comfortable, great audio and most importantly call quality is so well. person on the other will hear your voice loudly and clearly very useful for office people who takes call most of the day"
I am a Sony fan. First time I bought non Sony brand and this 1+ bullets are mesmarising with the great sound quality. I really loved it and will recommend for all music lovers.
I am writing this review after using it 3 months.Battery Backup: Never lasted after using full day.Bass and Sound Quality: If It's fit in your ears then give you sound what to you really want to hear.Design and Comfort: you can wear as long as you want yo use it.
Overall it's okay but one which is defect in this is if you speak long the sound getting automatically slow downThen again you have to disconnect the call and recall for clear voice
"Excellent product battery backup too nice automatic on off (tuch boath with magnet) is very fantastic ideaSound quality not too loud nor less but in average, noic ecancellation excellent ,bass quality veery high which is hart of voice, overall very nice products thanks to Amazon"
The sound quality is very good with bass and on single charge we use them for 17hrs which is exceptionally good.
Lovely sound. Each and every content of the music is clear and balanced. Best bass.Scarely fast bluetooth connectivity.Go for it guys to get the best in its range.
wanna replace my one plus bluetooth it has suddenly stopped working..its beenn charged display light is also coming but no bluetooth connnection is been established
One plus is a good brand as usual. From 2000 to 1800 has been drop so it was a good opportunity for me to buy. Fully satisfied with the product.
"Satisfied with the product. Very good sound quality, noise cancellation and bass quality. Apt to receive bluetooth calls, call reciever claims perfect sound from mic during calls."
13/09/21को बाय किया था मैं घर पर नहीं था आउट ऑफ स्टेट था 21 तारीख को मैं घर पर आया तब इसको ओपन किया चालू नहीं हुआ सबसे घटिया क्वालिटी का है मैंने1 दिन भी यूज नहीं करपाया सर्विस सेंटर पर पड़ा हुआ है आज तक और उससे भी घटिया सर्विस अमेजॉन की जिसमें प्रोडक्ट रिफंड का कोई ऑप्शन नहीं हैं
Very bad product... I really shocked about one plus neckband.. whlie receiving the call that time the band is automatically disconnected. That's y I return the product for repair on 28th Nov. But still I didn't get any status about my neckband.. very worst product I ever seen in my life...
"This lacks the quick switch button that older OnePlus bullets wireless Z had.And beleive ne if you have used the older earphone you will miss that features a lot.Otherwise a great earphone.Great sound quality, great battery life. Very ergonomic."
"This product is not good , while speaking some extra sound will be their not able to speak using this product, so i want to return this product"
The product is with a good finishing and call quality is awesome...  Very good compatible with one plus 9 pro.. have a long bluetoothe range
I bought 3 pcs in Jan 2021 Republic Day sale one for me and other 2 for friends. And we all faced same issue that this has broken due to poor Build Quality. Now left side speaker has stopped working.
"Sound is just too good. Noise cancellation should be improved.Battery back up is awesome.After using few months the magnets are becoming week,as a result the headset remains always on when inside the bag.There should be a dedicated on/off switch."
Price is worth it 😉 if I talk about this Earbud.Bass is superb 👍 packaging was good.M Happy with OnePlus product
After replacing my product is working fine. I didn't find any mejor issue after replacing. Given 4 star because of the overall experience is not so good as i think. But I'm satisfie now.
Sound quality not good compared to oppo.My opinion oppo good.In oneplus back side resound coming.That is the draback.This is my opinion only.2000 waste.. Take a good decision.My opinion is in sound quality sony and oppo are best.
I bought it in 6 June- 2021 after a year probably on 4 June 2022 it stopped working one side was not working I sent it for repair they cancelled it saying it don't have warrenty on 6 June- 2022 it is not worth buying buy boat rockerz 330
Static noise. Bass not affective. Too expensive. Apple wired headphones are far better that this one and is in the same price range.
I was using using realme buds 2 wired for 2 years...now i have found an worthy upgrade for that OP buds 2...this has Superb audio quality and it has good battery backup. Only  drawback i found was lack of bass in this except that this one is dope ✨
Works like a miracle with oneplus phone. Auto detection on bluetooth phone and superb sound quality. Light wiegh and clear call quality.
"Please guys don't go for this in this price basically you will expect a better call communication but in this earphone you will only get torture,do not buy this product very bad, and I'm can't able to return please help me to refund or return this product."
No complete noise cancellation.Bass quality is average.Not satisfactory on this price.Build quality is not that good.
It just goes blank. Doesn't get connected to phone. Then have to reset again and again and this happens 3-4 times in a day. Then connects on its own. Avoid
"Doesn’t switch between 2 devices,Earphones doesn’t turn on sometimes.Button issues"
"Superb, catches each and every music bit with good Bass. Much balanced and too comfortable.I have used other brands were they mainly go for bass and will miss the melody of musicNice product OnePlus 👍"
Previous version of wireless z was better... Better quality better battery life... With mike so better audio as well. This covers background noice and its difficult to hear actual voice.
Writing review after one month of use... Starting it was good.. But sometimes doesn't connect for calls and eventually after a month mic stopped working..... Even my friend experienced the same and he returned the product... So better not to go for this unit..
"The One plus bullet Z Bass edition is better than the best in this segment.  Also I used One plus bullet Z edition (Noemal) but this item bass edition is really good, bery good sound quality, good bass and good sound filter. Overall this Bass edition is better than the best"
I bought this in bluetooth january and now when i am listening to the song the voice is coming right but there is a disturbance sound on the voice call
I wana thank you to the one plus Brand for making such a Amazing Earphones the bass quality is ultimate when I watch Movie its feel like i am in movie theatre Its cancel the all surrounding noies when you use earphones and sound quality is good and they need to upgrade the battery low compared to normal edition
Like the quality but definitely  the old version  was  perfectly  designed.. the mic and buttons were located  perfectly....new one is good but it would be  perfect.. ..i personal  prefer  old versionLove  Oneplus.. but this time i disappointed.. with bass Edition
"Sound qulity, connectivity and Battery back is good only. But we can't use this while travelling. No noise cancellation at all. Catches all out side noises.  If you want to check the noise cancellation do a voice clip in whatsapp. Its horrible"
- not the greatest sound quality as advertised.- call clarity is the worst..some sort of very loud disturbance during calls only and not while listening music- no dual pairing- doesn't always connect to the device automatically
"Very bad service ,There was a problem with the sound, so I sent it to the service center, but they closed the order with the tag of physical damage, very bad feedback, very unsatisfied service, Will not advise anyone to take a new one"
"Wonderful sound, best quality. I'm purchasing this product 2nd time. I had purchased it 1 and half year before due to physical damage it is no longer useful."
Huge disappointed with this product not proper working in my laptop after replacement i think i was looted ...crack sound in laptop when you increase or decrease sound
"The neckband is very good, mic quality amazing. Sound quality also better than old version. But there is no multiple devices connection option and device switching button."
"Its a good product but just for 6 month because after six month it will be got worst and if you get replace this piece, it will Again work  6 month"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Best in classNever compare this products from  any mid range other brand like boat or noise in this price segment.Built quality is perfect and flexibleSound and bass is best 🙂I love this product"
"Not as Aspected ,It's mentioned in the features that bass edition have quick switch option, but their is no quick Switch Button. I guess they have just copy paste features from their older edition to bass edition, so not aspect this from Oneplus...😢😢"
"Voice=better, butSometimes it automatically cut off from connected device and again I have to connect to connect it.AndNot properly charging,or getting long time to get fully charged.(2hrs).AndEven it get fully  charged it shows red light.Above all after using 5 months"
I dislike this product..purchased on 10 nov 2021...n on 18 nov 2021 it stopped working..I tried charging..bt it's battery drained..whn I tried to strt it..I take care of products..this is really shocking for me k itni jaldi it stopped working without any physical damage
"Simply Impressed with , product quality , sound quality in one word its a masterpiece,  you cant get better then this in price you pay ."
Left earphone volume kept going downNow low volume in left ear.Now in high volume scrating sounds are being producedMic is not so good better only for 3-4 days then call quality keeps degrading.Not returnable.Wasted my moneyNever buying again
After a lot of search finally found this and since purchase I haven't had a moment of regret. Highly recommended.
"While sound was good, the right side earphone stopped working within 2 weeks. Had used it only twice and one side stopped working all of a sudden. None of the Amazon reviews speak abt this issue. But if u google the problem, realised this is a common problem with most one plus ear phones!"
Use for connecting call and listning music.but all ihave to control by phone since beginning i hhad to move out of station the day i received so checked now there was no extra ear buds also appears that some defective return was sent to me without refurbishing.

 Good product...Sound quality was goodNoise cancellation okokBattery superBuilt quality goodBut have some issues with cleartyOverall good product"
Does not Expect this from OnePlus...There is some cracking noise comes from one ear of headphone and its really irritating never expected this.....also i replaced the first product but the second product also having same issue.... really disappointing....i returned the second product too...
I don't understand why the company is not considering all types of software development in designing a device...most of us r complaining about mic problem...I hope at least now they may provide exact driver of any crack file to make the device to function in all androids the best.. that is resolving mic issue
The first review that I am posting for any devicePros-1 Great battery life2 Excellent voice quality3 Excellent call quality4 superfast connectivity5 Fast chargingCons:Makes using products of other companies difficult
"Sound quality is good. Active noise cancellation needs to be better as while on call, lot of surrounding noise and disturbance is captured which interrupts the on going call/meeting.Battery backup needs to be improved. It gets discharged earlier than expected."
"Good sound qualitie for a wireless earphones, and good noise cancellation. But it can't connect simultaneously to 2 Bluetooth devices"
Very dispointed will this product... Because while connecting to call ...it's automatically disconnecting and after 10-15 sec later connect. If complaint also there is no proper response from one plus store.please don't buy this product.... buying this equal to put money in dust bin.
"Very poor quality product, without any physical damage or exposed to water BT earphones stop working in just 6 months, and not only mine but my friends also faced the same issue. So it’s very bad product in 1999 which works only 5-6 months."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I bought these headphones on 11th March and have been doing very well so far but since 26th April they have been ringing very loudly, listening to songs and talking on the call sounds very dirty."
"No doubts the product is pro, sound quality is descent soft and sweet sound. Build quality is also terrific. If you  like neckband then you should go for it because in this price segment it's the perfect one."
Hurts in the ears after sometime. Overall good
Rugged and best... Somehow I lost them speeding at 145 km/h listening Pink Floyd on my motorcycle. Just have placed a new order. 🤦‍♂️
Amazon broke my trustAmazon broke my trust Now I do not want to buy anything from here for the second timeपुराने ईयरफोन नीकले घटिया क्वालिटी केमै पुराना ग्राहक हू  फीर भी यह हुवा दुबारा कोई नई चीज नहीं लुगा ओर अपने साथी मित्रों को भी यह बात बताऊंगाबडा दुख हुआ है
The product has been stopped working in one ear within 2 months. The product is under warranty but I am unable to reach oneplus customer support for replacement.It would be batter if I bought from local store as they Handel end to end replacement service.
"Great set of Bluetooth earplugs. If you're tired of using average ones for a shorter while and experiencing discomfort at times, I'd suggest go for these. A bit expensive than the 'go to' ones in the market but they're a great investment."
"DO NOT BUY...  just 2 months not working / not charging atall..  Tried for warrenty claim , but no option found for claim. its worst experience!.."
"this is a really good product, good audio quality, better bass quality, super battery backup, in 10 min its get fully charged but the problem in it for redmi user it is disconnected automatically"
Its okayish. Similar products with similar quality can be found at much cheaper price point.
Sound quality and bass quality is good. Battery life is limited.. at a stretch works for not more than 6 hours. And sometimes it loses connection very easily.If in between a conference call if you get a normal call then this device completely loses connection with the phone
"Writing after 5 months of usage.Bass quality Superb.Superfast charging.Mic quality is also amazing.After trying so many like Boat, Realme, I decided to try One Plus and its really very much satisfactory."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Very good product.Noise cancellation is not up to the mark"
Worst product !Dont purchase this becoz dual paring is not available in oneplus........In my case return not accepeted.......worst return policy....You can go for boat if you want better quality and dual paring option with minimum cost..
"Worst product I have ever used. Within 15 days, issue of disturbing noise during calls was raised. Called customer care and suggested for reset. That doest solve the issue at all. Returned the same and waiting for replacement. So many customers with same issue noticed in service center."
These controls are very hard to useLess and small buttons make them even harder to use but only pro is sound is very good other than that you go with Sony neck bands which will cost you around 3k to 5k. But those are easy to use and best of  kind.
"There is a sound quality issue on both music and  during call. When we are talking on call, there is very strange kind of sound heard. Oneplus make better than this earphone in this price range. Verymuch disappointed with this product."
Super earphone. I give5 starafter 2 month using. Spper sound quality and battery backup is very longer than other. So. Everyone can buy blind the eye.
While I listening song if I attend any incoming call after call sound quality is very very bad.I have to reset it some times today I got this  problem 5 timesMaking noise when sound up and down
"It's a worst product quality is good only  few days after returning date is over.  it's having problems like disturbance during call, voice distrotion, speaker problem or water of product n waste of money not work properly."
"Good one. I am using it for the last six months. I don't feel any problems with it. Bass is good , thumbs up for battery life. Once fully charge, forget for the next 5-6 days. Go for it."
This is my honest reviewNo doubt go for this productBalance sound quality with deep bass and loudI don't know why there is more negative reviews for this product
"Good,music is  descent quality for the money we pay. Good thing is call quality , it is awesome and recepient never complaints on call quality. It's good for the calls and serves the purpose cleanly. Sound is descent not great"
No noice cancellation in this product. My original product mic stop working with in one month after complaint to one plus customer care... Company exchanged my product but I recieved after 3-4 weeks
Superb product for daily use. Call quality (noise cancellation) is very well maintained. Battery backup is also descent. You cam enjoy music and videos with great sound. Bass quality is medium.
Unless you have one plus phone this is good pair of headphones but sound quality I didn't like (JBL user) it's too much bass and crisp richness and separation is not so good.Also there is no low latency mode in other devices.Battery life best in segment.
"Overall I would give it a 3 star. Sound quality is great. The only problem that I encountered with the headset is, when connected to a non oneplus handset there's lot of glitch in line over call.Other than that you will experience finest quality of sound."
"Poor quality, left side speaker not working, mic not working. Within 10 month product going  dead jone while I am using with safety. So don't buy this product 😭, and you can choose realme oppo and other brands at this price segment."
The product is not functioning from the first day.As I didn't use it immediately after I received....I couldn't give a return resquest
"Battery getting drained just in half an hour use. After full charge & use of hardly 30min, battery will be completely dead by next morning. Looks like defective item has been delivered. Wants replacement or refund"
"Bass - Perfect, enogh boom to it, Doesn't destroys other frequencies.Vocals - Crisp.Build - ExcellentComfort - eartips are bit large,even the smallest one🥲 and they hurt my ears initially. I started using eartips from my jbl c100si and it feels better now😌."
That is verry poor quality earphoneBut Price is verry high so i suggested you guyz don't bought this Bluetooth.Company says something nd results totally diffrenet.So im verry repenting after buying this product.😔😔😔
The only drawback is battery life is verg poor and it's somehow waste of money moreover sound quality is good bass is just excellent no issue is pairing and very flexibleAlso Amazon only have to replace the Item not return that's painful
"Nice headset that fits well. Sound quality is decent enough for the price, but there was some delay in sound. the battery back up is also good."
"Not working properly, looks like duplicate or refurbished product. Don't buy."
If you connect this device with your mi phone it will make noise while you're on call.. And the customer service is also make you suffer like hell.. So it's better to buy this if you have oneplus phones. Don't know about vivo or oppo
Sound quality is not good. Base is also low. For listening music it is not recommended. Sounds clearity is good while taking through it.
Day 1 review..Charged 100%== 3hrs usage==30% battery remained.U can decide.
using it from one month ... honestly the product is truly recommendable . in terms of battery life and audio quality call quality noise cancellation it is justified product.
Best bluetooth headphones with better sound. The fast charging feature works like charm. Can be used for almost a day of mixed usage. Another feature was quick switch meaning I can switch between two paired devices by double tapping the pair button.
Ear lock system failedMy ear painOn of paten not matching so long time call add
I am happy with the headphone but it stopped working exactly 1 year after purchase. First the left earplug stopped and then right also in few days

 very nice bluetooth headset"
Getting crackling sound while making calls. Replaced set also has the same problem. One plus has to check and rectify it.
First I have ordered OnePlus bullets and received diffective bluetooth and I requested for replacement. In replacement order I have received one bowl instead of bluetooth. Now again I have ordered OnePlus bullets and I received only box without bluetooth 🥺
I am hearing an noise while hearing songs or watching videos i replaced and got refunded for 4 times even i am using iPhone 11 and also i checked with other smartphones I don’t know where the problem is
Described as upgraded bass edition but didn't found any difference vs previous version. Ols version was capable of switching between two connected devices however this 8d not capable of that option. Purchased hence have to use.
अमेजोन ने मुझे ना तो प्रोडक्ट दिया है और ना ही मेरा रिफंड किया कृपा करके या तो मुझे मेरा प्रोडक्ट दे या फिर मुझे मेरा पैसा वापस भुगतान करे
"I have to gift this to my friend so I ordered it before. But when I opened it, it was defective. there are some annoying noises while calling. I wanted refund or replacement but it was too late. 7 days were gone. i want warranty claim in this product which is for 1 year."
"Cheapest sound quality, not soothing to ears. very bad--OnePlus, just hyped brand, they cheat with nice packing--but products experience will not meet expectations."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 product inside is diffrent product with same level so might be refunished so i want return"
"Very poor call quality.. unable to hear the voice of the caller, clearly and caller also unable to hear from my side.. Facing this problem just after 10 days of delivery.After spending a this much of money, totally,disappointed to buy this product. Don't go for it."
"Excellent quality, it’s a replacement of the same item i ordered, Bluetooth connectivity is excellent,Battery life is good, compatible with laptops too"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The product is best 👌  Amzing experience asa well as build quality is very good 👍"
You can find batter than this..Go for Normal Bullet Z For More Battery and Batter Call Quality..
OnePlus is definitely best. The earphone is very good. The turn off and on system is unique and wonderful. Sound quality and bass system is also good. Hope it works for long run too.
"The earphones are meant only for music and if you are planning to buy it for gaming stay away from it.Right side earphones sound reduced after 1 month of using and now I have to avail the warranty.Also they are very delicate, I used them cautiously and still they got spoiled."
"Its good product in all means like packing, battery life and even sound quality, only drawback i experiencing is while attending a call or volume up or down, its not easy to ifentify the specific button without looking into it."
The best neckband it is light in weight and also the bass is excellent. Very happy with the connection process. Very quick and responsive
"This product is just waste money ... It's sound quality, cancellation is not up to the mark as per expectations from a such a brand. Now one ear bud got defunct ....Plz be away from this fake product"
"After 6 Months it's not working properly, atomatically Blutooth getting Disconnecing again reconecting.. not happy with this product."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 It's not pairing with mobile and right side is not working I was unable return the product which is not available. Then there is no Option for replace also time factor will say cruel"
"Battery back up and charging timing , no fast charging.no 10hrs battery back up once charged,Only 2-3hrs back up."
"Day by day one plus have issue in performance , duplication and refurbished.. all are refurbished product...Not good defective price received once, after I replaced , this one also defective mike not working ..Poor performance..."
Automatically connect when buds are separated gives a hands free ability to save from boring procedure of powering on the Bluetooth and connecting it to devicesGreat sound qualityAmazing baseComfortable to ears
"I received today one plus wireless neckband z , I'm very surprised as company commit charge 10 min and you can enjoy music 10 hrs it's totally fake commitment. Battery performance is worst, and other things is very impressive."
"Not good, replace two times but the same problem persist. This product have a continuous crackling noise at background while listening to something, moreover during calls it disconnect automatically and leaving call on normal mode.Not a good product."
"With in One year one side not clearly working, noise cancellation is worst, sound while calling is not good, calling audio is not well one sided, charge is good enough, one side audio not working"
noise during callsotherwise its a very good product in terms of battery and sound quality
"I wonder why some people said, bass is too much. Rather there is no bass at all. Dissappointed."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I used exactly 8months ,not completed 1year ,..... but LHS side  bug not working ,....!"
I've ordered same product two times and both the time got same issue. Voice is coming in e right side only. And not able to download the invoice also bcz of this service centre guys are not entertaining this product.
"Product is good. Connectivity also good. Sound and bass nice. But noise cancelations is very bad. Its very difficulty to talk while in driving. Facing Too much disturbence. Normal calling is good.And also Sound up and down buttons also have problem while pressing the +, - buttons"
1. Sound Quality Overall ok but not best.2. Noise Cancellation is better than expected.3. Battery 🔋 Backup 3 to 4 days on average rough use.Overall go for it. This gadget is extremely cool and healthy on this price range.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Actually after 2 months it is sound quality was very worst and another four months some parts of volume control buttons are fell down totally this is not the recommended device"
As compared to my previous wireless earphone(which was around 400 :D )this has much better sound quality  + clear voice calls as per current experience.
"If you are into music, this is what you want.If you want battery life, this is what you want.If you don't want to burden your neck, this is what you want."
"This is the best bluetooth headset I have ever had, I tried many previously not naming any brand but this one just tick every single requirement I had. It's worth every single penny."
Battery life is roughly 3-4 days but depends on usage. Bass quality is good and it definitely is a value for money
I received one plus earphones but I think so there is some technical problem in this. This ear phones automatically disconnected with my Bluetooth and I have to do it manually on off Bluetooth and I have to connect again and again very disappointing.
"Maheene 2 maheene ho gye liye hue, batt thik h sound quality thik hai...lekin call pr baat krne main useless hai...mike pr avaaj jati hi ni..dusri side pr log kehte rhnge aavaj aa ni rhi aa ni rhi..to...call k kaam ka ni h"
Again I would say Sound quality is best and no one can beat the sound or price in terms quality by OnePlus. This is only the best.
Pros:1. Really super fast charging2. Lasts long3. Good with soothing musicCons:1. No bass2. Earphones virbrates in your ears causing a tingly effect when you go for full volume.3. No active noise cancellation
"The product is an used one, the earpieces are filled in ear wax that is so disgusting.And the receiver is not working it seems.A complete disappointment."
The battery did not last even for few hours. And within three days it completely stopped working. Had lot of expectations from this product but based on my experience I would say DON'T BUY IT.
1. Its magnet not get auto attached. We have move the sides to each other earbud to make them attached.2. Sound quality is fine. Not superior.3. Wire is little hard and underquality.4. Not expected from oneplus.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I use it while driving,sound is good enough but the noise cancellation is not working working properly a knocking sound is there to second person."
My mom love this Headphones +Battery Backup and Long Bluetooth connectivity just Kill in it.
one plus wireless z bullets ko purchase kiye hue ek saal bhi nhi hota hai damage ho jata  connected nhi hota hai 2 years me 2 kharab ho gaye I suggested everyone not purchase one plus product specially wireless headphones
The product i till try to connect to the device motorola one fusion plus but till not connected
"From quality to performance , it's the best in last one year ..Battery just superb, sounds too good ,also fast changing supported . Fabulous ...."
"Not genuine material, second copy was available on all online platform, if you want trusted quality then buy on oficial store directly. I'm not satisfied with this product."
Its only and only good for voice calls.Battery back up is very bad.There is very less control on the buttons of earphones.My earphone's mic stopped working after 3 weeks of usage. So in this budget this is not good earphones. Try other brands.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 This is worst product plz don't buy this bluetooth I request you all don't buy to worst product"
"I ordered these on 4/7/21, and within a week, one of the earpieces no longer functions at all. I had the same pair before these, which lasted close to a year for me. Would not recommend this edition, however."
Ear phones are too good. Good quality.Good Bass qualityGood battery backupWill get nice music experience
"Dont purchase, i am only 2 months used and outgoing sound stopped"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Quality product, goodfor office use"
"Sound  quality ,noise cancellation and bass quality is amazing no comparison with other necbands . Best item by one plus  but i think one plus should have put bigger battery in this item because its not enough with this price . that's it ."
"There are some annoying crackling noise in the background, majorly during the low frequency sounds. Just run a headset quality test audios and then you can realise it easily. I replaced the product and the second one also got the same issue, then I requested for refund."
Very very waste this item.. because of blutooth connected phone & bullets but bullets for sound.. phone for sound..i purchased 4 months.. still these problem continues..so this is check nd purchase..my version this is waste money product
Everything is worst there is a usless warranty policy I am suffering from a technical issue for several weeks and i complained too but there is no any positive reaction of the company the customer service only fooled me
"Sound distortion and connectivity problem with the black varient.I also have red version of these earphones that's sounds pretty well but this one is soo disappointing product, not expected with the OnePlus brand."
"One important drwaback is that of multiple device connection, it does not have that you need to either switch it off or disconnect from one device to connect with another one of your paired devices"
No Bass .. high terrible... it pick all the noise from around.. No noise cancellation.
I'm using this product from 3 months .. it was good in the beginning but now cracked sound is observed during calls only.  Rest for music and movies it's good . But for calls I don't like it much . No performance at all . Not worth for the price
Very Nice Product bought on 2nd Oct writing review after 1month..I am sony fan was using wx series sony bluetooth. Post purchase this enjoying it wort to buy it. My overall review 4rating
Decent bass good sound quality...Calls are also good ...Good job op...keep rock
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Overall it is a very good product . sound quality is awesome and build quality is also very good.but price should be around 1500 is justified"
"The Audio Clarity is very bad, the sound cracks - with constant disturbance while listening to the music and also while speaking on the microphone.Would have returned it back if possible."
everything fine. except for the fact that they downgraded the older version.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I bought this product on 2nd of August ..Sound quality and product quality was good but after a week Mike not. The other person who I'm trying to talk can't hear my voice  ...Un happy with the product  ..😒😒"
"Mic was not functioning properly from day 1, I contacted Amazon and told them the issue, They asked to reconnect with the devices.. Still having mic connection issues, also no noise cancellation."
After 5 months of use experience connectivity issue and not get detected by any device because not show any Power also not charging light when connecting to cable provided with earphone.
"I tried it with different devices, same issue persist in calls or online meetings. Only one way use where we have to watch something works okay.Only pro I found is the battery life was good, gets charged fastly."
This bluetooth device is most powerful charging and good quality of noise and good quality of bass battery time is good and fast charge and I was buy this product second time
"Pro:1. Range.2. Price.3. Fidelity.Cons:1. Disconnect too often, like in every 30 min if you're watching a movie. Haven't faced this problem during calls2. Not suitable for gaming. Audio lags."
I ordered this and get a defective piece having noise issue in background. Then I replaced it. In replacement also it is having alot of noise in background. Not expected from OnePlus
Product is good but they have not given extra buds in the pack which I received
"All good, except the battery... Full charge goes for 5 to 6 hrs, not sure about the long run"
Quality is good. Battery backup is very good. Sound quality is upto the expectations as per the cost of the product.
"Not a good quality product, it's having mic issue. but if you are buying from offline it is good one.. Really very bad behaviour from Amazon customer care for asking to cancel/replace the order."
"Only on call using this headphones disconnected several times, main purpose we taken to attend call via headphones but receive call and multiple times disconnects"
Amazing bluetooth headphones with very good bass effect and quick charging batteries.Will reccomend for all rough and tough users.Only the cons I observed is the short length of wire. OnePlus Bullet blows the guns...
"It's very nice handy, powerfull product. Battery life is very good, handy to use"
This collar is very comfortable to use but not as great in terms of battery cuz battery get's drained easily by the accidental yet daily turning on of the collar
Good for the price. But not as good as headphone of similar price range.
Don't buy.. Connectivity problem.3 hai mere pass 3  ko replace  kiya Hai Or  .. Product problem Hai 3 ho 100 apko 1-2 achhe milenge overall worst product don't buy
"Sound quality is best , Bluetooth connectivity is very fast n good quality , don't buy if you are looking for noice cancellation"
It worked best for 2 months then it started to not output any audio for some time then again start working I feel it is good at hardware but the software integration is definitely lacking which can get better
Worst call experience I just brought it today people can't hear me never expected this from OnePlus please don't buy it if your going to use it for phone calls
Honestly I bought it with the hope that it would have quick switch like the older version.  Otherwise I think this is a good product fast charging and longer lasting. But lack of the quick switch feature is a HUGE let down!!
I'm using it daily I'm comfortable with it's performance and battery backup.
"writing this review after a week of usage, headphone is very good, initially faced connectivity issues while attending calls, (switching from bluetooth to earpiece) later it got connected perfectly"
Sound and bass quality are amazing but when it comes to noise cancellation I donno why people in phone can hear my surrounding sounds even the sounds are from lit bit distance from me
Does not fits the ear at all. Bought it because of the brand oneplus name. But niklaa money waist. I wish I could go back and buy my old realme waala.Really disappointed. Does not fits not the best sound quality the wires are so thin can anytime break.
Ear fit ok but there's no bassBattery backup okBass lover go with infinity glid 120 for good Bass compared infinity this oneplus bulles is a normal edition they only mentioned for sales tricks
I like it very much. Even if u charge for 10 minutes u can use it for 2 days. Very good sound.
Connectivity can be sometimes a headache..otherwise it's a value for money product
Sound quality is good. Receiving call is easy and voice clarity is good.
Product is good in terms of soundquality and bass if uh are looking for listening music its a best product buy it!!But if uh are someone who is looking for noise cancellation for better call quality its poor dont buy it.
Good but Old model is better it is single button to used. Under 1500Rs cost price better
I'm new to this kindof gadgets and it fulfills my requirement so I'm okay with it.
"Review after using for 3 months : Overall, a very good quality product.. battery backup and charging time is also as same as that mentioned in product description..."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 After replacing again I got Very poor quality product which is not working. Screen recording is attached for your reference. Don't ordered this product from Amazon buy it from store."
I also tire of sony but the quality which is not available in sony earphone 4000 that quality is in this 2000 earphoneMere hisab se isse acha earphone is price me milega hi nahi

 Mujhe yahi headphone badalkar chahiye kuchh time automatic Bluetooth disconnect ho jata hai aur FIR connect ho jata hai connect hona bhi bahut let se connect Hota Hai"
"Product is good at the initiatial stage, after 10 days i am facing charging issue .if possible please replace the product."
"It produces some kind of noice when on call. I got a replacement product, but the problem existed in the replacement product too. This is a newer version of the product and the previous version was really good."
Sound quality is average in oneplus bullets z bass edition. Oppo enco m31 is better in sound quality and having high-resolution sound and LDAC codec. Battery is good in one plus  bullets z bass edition. Don't go for it if u look for sound quality.
Decent SoundGood BatteryBut Connectivity issues.. Sometimes mic doesn't work.. Since 15 days my Bluetooth mic is not working...Average noise cancellation
Bought and used it..Decent sound and good bass effect.Worth buying..
1.prosSound qualityBattery 🔋BassLight wait2.ConNoise cancellationOvell good product in 1999/-Rating (4.3/5)
Chattering sound while raising & lowering volume listening music which is very annoying and irritating
It's so easy to wear and handle when you go running.  Worth buying for me.  I use it all the time and the sound is also superb. Go for it.
I purchased one. But cant charge it. Also not working. Can't connect it with my mobile through Bluetooth.
I am using it. It is best for the music but average for calling. Because noise cancellation was average. If you are looking in this price range then I suggest please don't get confused by other neckbands just go with this.
Good one. Great battery life. Worth buying. Magnetic system is very useful. Only demerrrit I felt was it will not ring if not in ear. So that we have to keep phone nearly always.
Sound - 4.5/5Bass - 3.5/5Charging Speed - 1/5Battery - 4/5Connectivity - 4.5/5Oneplus Service 0/5
After a month network connectivity issue started..... Voice calls were distributed.....Nice cancellation isue is tooo much
"Very compatible with laptop as well as smartphones . Voice quality is really good , the only this which a bit problem is mic sometimes doesn't give clear voice to the receiver end but that's manageable at this price .Overall it's a great product ."
Sound quality not good. Performance not satisfied. Ofter one day use speaker sounding differently
"First of all thankz for my friend for suggesting me this item, sound quality is best,almost the 100%perfect one for music lovers.i was about in doubt before purcjasing this item nut after i got it, i am tottally happy with it🥰"
Sound quality and noise cancellation is really good but it has issues pairing with Spotify or gaana. Basically often unpairs itself which is quite irritating sometimes.
Totally very sharp and clear but i am purchased this item last 7 days ago and now it is not work properly if i off this headphone then sound automatic on in earif this problem in one headphone then its ok i will change my product if totally headphone this type
Cheap quality.. never buy itSound quality is too poor noise cancellation and bass quality is very cheap
"There is a frequency variation while attending calls and receiver hears buzz noises.Apart from that,the sound quality is great and battery life also good.The packaging was good and received with no damage"
Overall good puchase ....Bass quality is ok not goodProduct quality is good

 Dear Team,Order is received  but iam out of home So ill open now But product  is not in the box so kindly  refund my money iam not satisfied with this type of nature of work."
It's been 7 months and one ear piece is not working even mic is not working properly
Almost ok but charging port don't cover Pls cover the charging port .Thank you.
A third class product which Amazon has fleeced me after being a loyal user for more than 4 years. They deliberately didnt allow me to replace the damaged item even after reporting several times. Also there were many parts missing in the box
"It has very good bass,good vocal quality but the problem is when your on a call it might get a problem during calls bcz the mic is not the best and it gives a cracking sound when your on a call"
I had ordered this item because I wanted quick switch & dual pairing feature. Both of these don't seem to work. There is no quick witch button alsoSuper disappointed with One plus
The light indicator is pretty annoying and there’s no option to turn off that thingThat is the worst thing in these earphones otherwise sound quality is good & bass alsoBut if you’re a night person then you will be irritate by this earphones
Average Build quality. Very lengthy wire and bulky battery pack. Never satisfied. Also it stop right speaker with in a month.
Very bad experience i want replace it i bought it 20 days ago and now there is conastant noice coming whenever i call someone
Liked the build quality & ease of use.Missing dedicated button for switching between devices.
"Its a very nice product. It possessing its specifications what was the company mentioned. Its battery backup is best, music listening is best, everything is super. Just buy it and feel it"
"Started getting crackling sound during call,it has not fixed even after resetting the phone  or headphone.it is a known issue with thjs band,so please donot buy this item,r"
The product is most worst one which I buy from Amazon. The headset get damaged within one week...when I claim the headset the company rejected ..and they told me that the headset has been cracked...this is the most worst product
"Build quality excellent, charging backup excellent, ruf & tuf using,"
The Oneplus Bullets Wireless Z Bass Edition Bluetooth in Ear Earphones with mic (Black) are excellent sound quality
The product was awesome since for a few weeks..and all off a sudden it's making some fuzzy voice and not getting connected to any device. I was not even given a warranty card so that I could do something with that. Now I don't know what to do.
I would rather give 0 star. Please dont buy. There is no quick switch option available for this price. Voice is also not clear while in meeting.  Difficult to switch between gadgets. Pathetic and unhappy with amazon as product return is also not taken.

 Very bharsht service everytime suffring this problem ek side no any response only one side lestion one side no any response so please collect your etem urgent"
After one month usage I write this. It's a best friend for music lovers. For general usage guys notice this I don't know when I charged in last time it's still have 40% strength.Boss is also so cool 😎👍
"Worst product I have been using this product from six months and now it has many issues like low output voice, distrubance while in a call, low connectivity.  Looking for a replacement of this product"
"In 15 days of use , in call getting crackling sound. I want to replace this product.kindly give me customer care number or whom to contact for replacement."
Other than bass it has lower build quality than that of the normal Z.This does not have the switching button between two devices.I would suggest you to buy the normal ones as it has better built quality.
It gets disconnected the Bluetooth automatically during connection.
Its not even working with OnePlus 9R for Gaming while playing PUBG mostly my mic is not working my teammates are not able to hear me..  other than gaming it's working good..👍
One of the best earbudsSound quality is awesome❤️Bass-09Treble-10Battery backup-10Clarity-10One of the best product to listen to is music in this budget.I am just loving it❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"Best for calling. Good noise cancellation. Automatic turn on and turn off. Good battery back up. Go for itBass is not good, so not good for music, but best for calling"
When ever I spoke with others some distrub sound came both a end. Now I m using only hearing music only. Retun time completed no way to exchange this.
"Even though it charge for 1 and half hour, red light doesn't turn into white. But we check the  charge through bluetooth in phone, it indicates 100%"
"Battery backup, connectivity and sound quality are best.Go for it"
Best earphones for one plus  devices.almost zero latency will gaming.and great sound quality. Overall best earphones you could ever find for ur one plus device in this range.
I have ordered this item twice and both the time I got defective piece. Very disheartened to receive a product which has such good reviews. I have placed a replacement again hope I get a good product atleast this time.
"Truely Value for Money Product... ""Boat"" give you bass, but fade the vocals and treble, but One Plus gives you very clear sound, u can differentiate each instrument... with Decent and Balanced Bass! true music lover will definitely like One Plus"
This is only for music not for playing games or for calls there is some worst background noise on the other side they won't be able listening your voice please don't be for calls or playing games worst product that I have purchased
I purchased one plus wireless z bass edition in july 2021 and after 4 months it stopped working suddenly. How can I claim for the warranty. Guide me asap..
"Awesome just missy he old edition becz it has many features too 😒 like dual connectivity and  and seperate buttons for volume and audio was also good in older version ,still in market this product is excellent 👌"
The earphones are excellent. But the right earbud stopped working without any reason in 6 months. And there is no replacement warranty too. Disappointed that a brand like OnePlus can stop working just like that.
Had a problem with call voice on both ends.4/5 times the call voice is garbled and disturbed.
I like the product as I expected but only charging is not in expected hours rather than that everything is good
"Sturdy durable and reliable, just that earlier button of switching devices is removed"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 It's been only 7months bought this oneplus bullets bass edition.. and safety guard of left ear piece joint was teared.. and then ear piece stopped working.."
"while making calls, the receiver hears a ringing noise and the conversation is not understandable at the other end.  Its a horrible experience for the receiver while making calls.  not using the device anymore after 2 months."
Connection lost during call. Sounds not clear. Not good product. Annoying me. Plz guide me how can I replace this.
"Sounds quality is very good, instantly connected to device, if you not use then headset is gone automatically in sleep mode it will save our battery, and battery quality is very good."
"One plus has definitely done a good job. overall quality of the product is very good but i will give it a 4 out of 5 due to it,s sound quality . Bass is excellent but can be improverd in sound as well to give a rich quality sound to ears."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I was shocked to see product fully damaged and already using product"
"Poor quality, its ear buds r painful for ears better buy any other brand"
while ordering this product i expected thst it will recieve in very well condition and with every accecerios mentioned in the prodect detail.. and later when received the product. the package ing was in wrost condition and also didn't have some in ear accessories.
The only thing stopping me from giving it a 5 star is the crackling sound it produces sometimes. Other than that it's just awesome like in every aspect.
Sound quality is as expected. Great bass and clear sound. Call quality is great too.
Call receive button problem after then old edition better performance call receive button....
"Noise problem observed when I used my Redmi phone, after visiting service centre they replied need to update your mobile phone 2019 model. (After I used my new model phone 2021 it is ok)."
Worst experience with these premium earphones...even not compatible with OnePlus mobile phones...u can't talk on phone with these earphones..some background sound always disturbing u... buttons not working properly in changing the tracks... please don't buy...
"Good to hear music but if you plan to call and talk over this ,consider other options . It makes weird sounds and it's impossible to talk with that thing going. Not even a year and this happens"
Sound starts lagging after sometimes when I play and video music or watch any movie on Iphone. Not sure if this is the problem with only iphones or other phones as well.
Bought the product at 1799 at great Indian sale. Didn't live up to expectations. Sound quality and battery is not good compared to non bass edition.
"Older headset was good with mic facility, this new bass edition is waste in noise cancellation and lot of noise in between the long calls. In one word, feels like this is the duplicate product of 1+"
"Excellent battery life, charges quickly, and the magnetic disconnection function is my favourite.. sound quality is great"
Good quality. But I am not sure if it is water proof that can be used during rain because charging point is open for water to affect. And mic did not work on falling in water. As usual Rice bag helped :)
Had been using sony earphones for more than 2 years. Sound quality was way better than these. Not suitable for music. Noise cancellation is a sham in these.
While on call our voice is not audible for another person..If the Mike is near then only they can hear our voice..And Mike is not near to speak also
Good product... Value for money... Nanum nallah irukunu kelvi pattuthan vaangunen ipothan use panni paatha aprom than theriuthu romba nallah product... Realme and boat vida ithu better quality.
Sounds quality is good but not that good compared to other in range buds however it does feel premium. Battery is not good too. Noise cancellation is fine although other person can hear some sound of the sorrouding.
I am so disappointed in this product after using this for 9 months i can tell these earphones only last for 10 months.
I have used with an iPhone X and iPhone 7 but sound quality is very poor. Lots of cracking sound in the background while playing music/ YouTube videos . Not recommend for iPhones . I have received a replacement but still problem exists
What to inform that the review is posted after using the headphone over an month nice sound quality and bass decent battery backup
Best sound quality.Best quality material.Durable
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Worth every penny"
Its priced double than other popular brands but not worth buying for extra bucks .. you get no extra features.. buy boat instead below 1k and decent noise cancellation.. better than this for sure
"Hii all I'm using these earphones last 10 days these earphones is good for listening 🎧 for music and as well as classes,coming to charging section awesome,quick charge,very comfortable and finally these earphones for these price segment"
"It become faulty after 3 months of use, I took replacement from one plus stores. After 1 year of use it again became faulty. No replacement so I have to buy another pair, bought other brand this time."
Hi I bought this product before four to five months. But left side ear phone is not working properly not able to hear the sound . Can u please look in to this and as it is warranty can I get replacement.
The only problem I face is that its bluetooth connection faces interference from my laptop's 2.4Ghz wifi connection when connected to the laptop. Otherwise everything is good for the price.
"I bought this for 1.8k and quality is worse that a substandard 900 headphones. I thought it was jsut one off defective piece but even after the repalcement , the issue persists.Better to buy boat headset instead of this one"
Highly recommended everyone to this productJust close eye's and purchase itBass this excellent & Sound quality is too goodLove this product ❤️
2nd time i bought it. Love it
"Don't buy one plus item, there is less number service cebtre. I am from MP, here  service centre is available in only 5 district out of 51 district. So I am getting problem to repair my earphonePlease don't buy one plus item"
Don't buy if you expect long life. I have tried two pieces with same model one is black and red one. Both doesn't lost long. It just works for 6 months. Cable quality is poor. Don't go for this.
"The sound quality is very poor. I do not what happen now , when I used this bullet wireless to call some one they always complaint that my voice is coming very bad. I want exchange this. Can hou help me"
I'm loving the product... Bass quality is good... Its not that high but its nice... Over all sound and noise cancelation works great... Simply superb... Loving it 😍😍😍😍😍
Better then Buds as it's risky of losing and it's very durable... easy to connect and magnetic feature is great to save battery life
"I had used one pluse bullet before, they worked great. These are fine but they are very slow to connect to mobile on the go. Hence not enjoying for office work"
I bought it on 26 march ..it work well for 13-14 days after that it is getting diconnecting itself even you are in front of paired device... the sound gets buffered sometimes due to connectivity issues .
It's quite good but 'Quick Switch' is not there in it which is the most biggest negative point or you can say because of which I don't like it.Sound cancellation is just kind of myth I can say as it doesn't work that good.
Mobile is connected with bluetooth. But the call voice is on ear piece only.Sometimes by default it disconnects while we are on callNot to buy at all
Sound acha he....Noise cancellation avrageBass quality goot but not too goodBatry only 1.5 day (heavy use)Batry boat me achi he
"Very good product, worth for money, i enjoyed a lot with music as well call, very good design for regular use and one request from my side is need to give some rubber or platic for close the charging port"
"After use of 8-9 days, it started making static noise and it is very frequent. I cannot return it now because the return window has been closed. very disappointing experience even after paying 2k INR. 🙂"
"I am using this wireless since approx 2 years it very good and the most important things is flexible, quick switch, and quality of rubber..."
Product is fine but not long lasting because i have used it only 9 months and the stop working no one will come to replace or maintaince at home until i have warranty of 1 year but no one cares
"Hello Sir/MadamThis product is having one year warranty. But this one, one side speaker is not at all working.Please replace and do the needfulDr Purushotham DR here"
"There is lot of disturbance (noise) in speaker while talking with it, This problem will come in One Plus too and it will come so soon, we didn't knew it. We need replacement of this as soon as possible."
"This product have so many defectsFirst I brought it then it have a mic defect So I replaced the product ,then the new product have a button defect that when  I press the volume button it have a crackling sound ."
Worest device made by one plus company u can't able use on bike it's. Too worest experience my suggestion don't take the 1 stvthey made good but now they bult a mic in the frame u can't able to talk...tooo worest they made
"The only thing I want in this product is the best quality in sound quality and should develop a little bit.  The company and the word which is twitter, which is chick chick chick sound, also has a little bit of it."
but there's no 2 device switching option for non one plus devices.
"I have purchased it as a gift , and now i came to know that its work only when plug into charging .. Can’t expect this from the huge brand one plus .. i really dont know what to do next , as its useless for anyone ."
"Bass is good. Sound quality for the music is not that much great. Some times, some disturbed sound is comming through the right earpiece while attending calls. It would have been better if they include a mute button as well."
"It continuosly disconnecting while playing PUB G. I think Amazon has shipped my a defected product or this is a normal issue while playing pubg. Though I am using oneplus 7T pro, it's sound got mutted after every 5 minutes."
It was working fine with my one plus mobile but when I switched to my laptop the audio was not even clear and after I reset it and directly pair it to laptop it worked nicely for 5-6 min but then same issue with a lot of noise.
"try to switch on blutooth, but not on  after replacing same product but Blutooth not on same problem i am face in both blutooth"
1st time send newspaper and second time send used product.i purchase one plus ear phone and send used boat product in OnePlus box.
Battery last 4 hr onlySo poor performance
Missing dedicated switch key. Also there is glitch everytime you increase or decrease volume. Battery backup is the biggest flex. Enough volume and bass ~good sound quality.
Using from more than 2 months and no complaints so far. Get charged very quickly and can be used throughout the day once charged.
buy this headphone only for its charging speed.sound quality is avg.frequent disconnects while using it.sometimes pairing issue can be seen when battery is low.
"Nice build quality and the sound is also good. Call quality is seems fine. Some time observing connectivity issue within the distance of 10 meters, rest it is working fine"
Quality is very poor & service centre is very worst.
After 2 months of use it was showing problems... Voice is not coming from both sides🥺😥😥😥😥😥Waste of money and it shows warranty of 1 year. And I am not able to replace it
Osm Sound quality
Just Go And purchase this is All time Best Product..... Never before Never afterIt's NEVER SETTLE
"Truely worth the money. Good sound quality, bluetooth range. Best feature is quick charge. Charges close to half withing 15 mins. So no hassle in case battery is low near to meeting time 👍"
After using it for more than a month I am constantly facing the connectivity issue. Initially it was working fine. But after few days this wrong thing happened to start.The Bluetooth gets automically disconnected.
Nice Packing. Good Bluetooth Headset. Good Sound and Bass. Sufficient Battery backup. Recommended.
A background score is getting played in loop mode eventhough there is no song or app is open. Tried to reset multiple times and tried to connect to other phones as well but still the problem persists.
They add in discription with mic but I got without mic and with all bad qualities. One side speaker not working
Amazon is selling duplicate products of top brands headphones is making disturb nois no one can hear voice on call. And Amazon refused to take it back pathetic service.
Awesome earphones.. Bass quality is superb.. As they say 100% noise cancellation.
"Not good at all.Whenever connect to phone, it affect to Wifi and Mobile internet connectivity.Automatically both wifi and mobile internet get disconnected or work slower.Really bad product. Frustrating from day 1"
"I was lil doubtful after noticing the dirty tape instead of the company seal but when I opened it, earbuds were full of ear wax. This terrible experience was never expected from sellers on amazon"
In This Price Range It’s A good product by one plus . Sound quality is good . Bass is also good . Noise cancellation is average but overall is best in this price range . Build quality is also good . 4.5 Star Put Of 5.
Sound quality is very good and external noise cancellation was pretty decent given the budget. The quick switch is not as expected and it's kind of similar to the usual switching between one device to another
Connection Was Not Proper. When I am Connecting With Wifi On Its get disconnected all the times. When I am Using Mobile Data Its Good. But I donno what's the problem. So I am asking you to look into It.
Got a blue colour one although I ordered black one still thought to keep it but worst decision ever made now it seems like a fake product as it automatically switches off and on really disappointed @Amazon
"I have One of the best product from Amazon site., this headset....Long bty backup within 10 min charge..."
"It's not working properly, after full charging it is getting off automatically and when we put in charge light is showing after removing it is not showing may be battery problem i think"
1.I love this Product💝.2.Purchased in Republic day sale with 1800rps  price.3.But little disappointing thing is no quick switch button & noise cancellation is very poor.
"Easy to use but it had compatibility issues with the devices other than one plus, sound is distorted while calling....I have been facing this issue since the start...."
"Total waste of money bought OnePlus head phn previously, which was good. But this one is useless it will disconnect automatically after sometime. Sometimes it wont show in bluetooth."
Easily useful for my work. good product.
Purchase date 12th August but not working from day one . I thought there is a issue with phone . But it is working fine . When we connect bluetooth . Calls are not audible for other person. Pls don'buy . Not worth for money
There is a lot of static disturbance while using these bluetooth head phones. Tried a factory reset and re-pairing....no improvement.
"I thought music on with OnePlus neck band but literally feeling like near to sunOn calling its is wrost i ever seen a product like thatPreviously i used boat, jbl, and samsung those are v good comparing to this"
It is as normal as other headphones with just brandes printed on it
Good sound quality. Go for it
Currently using I'm using 2 phones samsung M40 and oneplus nord goes perfectly with both of thm. It's a bit more swifter with oneplus nord. Genuinely has great battery life and sound experience.
Yes I use the product and the bass was to good and classic 👌and totally good❤ In under Rs 2000/-But I got this product in offer Rs1825/-
Very bad quality of earband recieved. Very low battery backup and poor sound quality. I did not like it
"one of the good earphones with ergonomic design, no pain in the ears from prolonged usage( this might vary from person to person). Bluetooth response is pretty good."
Can’t give a review because i have bought for someone else.
"I have been using this earphone for a couple of months, bass quality and sound quality, connecting speed is very good but the connecting range is not good. Quickly charge and no need to recharge too early.  Honestly, it's worth buying."
You can use on bike and rush places alsoIt’s giving good quality
Need to replace is not working properly
"During the call voice quality is very bad.During the call, the voice comes out loud, which makes it difficult for the other person to understand.I totally unsatisfied with one plus."
Hear music and watch movies with good quality sound but whenever you call sound echo is bad problem. I have reset phone and earphone many time but there is persistent problem of echo
"worth buying it if you are a OnePlus user, its giving handsome performance if you're one of the OP usee"
AWESOME PRODUCT ONEPLUS 😍😍😍PUBG LOVERBEST ONE PLUS
The headphone performance is good but Within 2 months the headphones sound quality decreased and While you speak there is irritantinf disturbance. I will not recommend people to buy. Poor speaker quality
How can I raise complain .. my headphone is within warranty but unable to hear the music from right side of the head phone one is working and the other is not . Very much disappointed
Pathetic product... Not last for even 1 day...  Don't waste money on it... Even after full charge not working... Not worth buying...
Ok ok product......
"Mic some timmes not working, Voice getting break while talking over phone, Blutooth getting disconnect automatic, lots of time did reset but problem not solved yet."
It's just. 10 days completed and one side earphone not working some time not connected automatically .... It's very bad products I don't want to give 1 star also ... Not received proper product very disappointed...  I want my money back...
"-Product is very good , sound quality is good- Noise cancellation is not that good- Battery life is more than 6 hours-product touch and feel is very good"
Likes :-Sound qualityBattery back upCharging timeConnectivityDislikes:-Noise cancelationNoise cancelationNoise cancelationYeah noise cancelation is not good in this headphones
Really good in sound quality.Woth for 2K .Recommended for purchase.
There is this crackling voice in between and even after replacement it is not working fine.It really gives headache and of no use if you want to use it for call or meeting purpose..Very costly when compared to cost..
headphone & sound quality is too good.. but noise cancellation is too bad.. speakers are frequently complaining about background noises and also about voice is not clear..
I dislike this product as it is intended to use only for music and it is not fulfilling my requirements.There will be huge disturbance while fan is running.
Ek dum bekar hend free hai bike chlte time iss bt nhi kar pta hai bs iska sound hi badiya mere dost nay bhi li thi oski dusre din bd hi calling karte time robot ing awaj aati hai
I received delivery on 21 june 2021.But yesterday i.e 11/10/2021 this product neither on/off nor connect to blutooth of any device. So I am not satisfied from this OnePlus blutooth
Worst product not worth to buy after 10 days observed left side wire problem not a reliable product never recommond it
I received a defective piece where sound ouput was different between left and right ear.Right ouput is lower than left output during soft musicKindly check once you receive the product.
"after 15 days of the order received the battery is not working properly. Only half an hour on stand by mode. I thought Oneplus was a good brand and opted for this headset, but this is too worst regarding the battery."
"Pro:1. I love magnetic on/off, quickly connect to device2. Good battery life3. Light weight.4. Quality built, good wireCon:1. Doesn't noted."
"Dear Team,Product was good but, since Am facing issue with Blutooth Not connecting so,Am requesting you to please Replacement it asapRegards ....Prince ..."
"Products no worries, but delivery Thursday has date but still Friday this one of disappointed.....today 23,,eveingtiming to sounds prblm"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Super sound quality amazing design excellent buttons"
"Sound,quality and fits perfectly in the ears"
Very long battery life and quick chargingSound is also very good
"I did not have any expection, but literally sounded better than my wired shennheiser ones"
Not much difference which local players
Value for money
This wireless neck Bluetooth is so good its built quality is pitty nice battery backup is average it charges so quick and sound is so good and its comfortable as well
"Sound quality is nice.... Battery backup is not as expected... Doesn't make much difference with other bluetooths, even boat has very good battery backup then OnePlus bluetooth"
"The product is good but I have issue in this product so where to do complaint is not mentioned and no local service office , I have issue of voice breaking and not proper  work.so kindly guide or resolve this issue."
"When I first got the product, I experienced a lot of disturbance and crackling sound during calls. I got it replaced, and the same thing is happening. I had high hopes with this, however it's the worst product!"
"I like the quality of the product ... But sometimes sound crackles alot..though i replaced my first neckband for the same crackling issue and got the new one, but sometimes it crackles too still I'm using by reseting it."
"I liked this product because of its fast connectivity, battery life ,and sound ..it captures minute sound ,after 6 months of usage one of the speaker stopped working.."
It doesn't have anything to show whether the device is on or off.. Very poor connectivity. Over all a horrifying experience. Waste of money to buy this product.
"Not recommend for gaming, 2sec delay, calling ,sound qulity and connectivity to good"
"Very low quality used 5 month. Headset not working. During warrent period send for repair, they are saying have physical damage and not given warrenty. Really cheating"
"Everything is good. I personally find it difficult to switch between devices as bluetooth must be turned off in one device before using it in another. Sometimes, it takes time to connect."
Good for call purpose however they disconnect on regular basis.Also in middle of the call you may loose voice.But it’s manageable.
The main product is okay but I don't know if  Amazon opens the boxes because I have not received the charing cable or any extra ear tips to fit my size.. This irresponsible behavior is highly inconvenient for me
Nice product. Nice build quality. Battery backup not bad.Sound quality better than any other earphones.☺️Nice bass
"A decent product for the price. Bass is not that heavy but enough. If you're a heavy bass lover, you won't be satisfied. For normal music lovers, you will be satisfied. Overall rating 7.5/10."
I was most disappointed that It doesn't support dual pair. And if you don't habe a OnePlus device you may not experience the best quality. But still the product is good. I wont say it cant be recommende.
"Call experience is very bad, i have tried it in different mobiles, but same problem in all mobiles"
Sound quality is good but only the big problem in this when i connect it to system for office meetings others cant able to hear my voice so its totally uselless product for office purpose
Ph call noise problem
"I have been using one plus from 2012 & to today I am also using one plus 8, ordered one plus  head phone after 12 Andiorid it is not working kindly help as I have spent Rs.1999"
Awesome quality earphone with good bass quality and better noise cancellation. Sound quality is just perfect!! Overall value for money. Recommend to buy this product
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Sound Quality is Good , Quick PairingBass Quality is Ok Not excellent.Value for Price"
"Doesn't connect to BT dongles very well, with phone works alright"
The earphones are good in this segment
From long time I was looking for a good earphone and finally got the right thing. Happy with the product.
"It's not Working automatically from 2-3 months ago OnePlus bullets see my all orders #oneplus,Really i always purchase OnePlus products see my account"
"This product is absolutely amazing,due to better sound quality and battery backup also awesome, and flexibility whenever I wear it I feel very comfortable to take any phone call so that's why I like it"
Good Product
"After 10 days of use, started getting continous noise during call. Its unbearable to use it while talking using this earphone, noise sounds is continuous all the time"
OVERALL NOT GOOD ALONG WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE
Wrost product by oneplusNot worth itI replace it fisrt i thought only my product was damaged but all bass edition is wrostAlso right wire is long then right one i want my money back
This device doesn't have protective cover for its charging port and it take 30 mins to switch on... I mean my cell phone takes 45 sec to reboot and start .... Never to buy OnePlus again.!!!!!
"Update after 1 month of use.There is crackling sound in the background that comes during calls games music anything randomly. During calls, once the crackling starts, it continues."
"Liked the bass that these bullets produce. The battery backup is enough for a few movies.The clarity could've been much better.Noise cancellation is alright, not awesome!"
Something was defect in your  product then I was return this product... But av tk mera refunf ni aaya hai... Mujhe ab replace item nahi chahiye... I want my refund... Plzz refund my balance
"There is no Noise cancellation.. but sound quality is good.. good for music.... Also for gaming... There is some latency in non OnePlus devices... latency is like 1/10...not to muh latency, only when gaming.. no latency in videos..."
"Poor headset. Not a clean output, has noise fillers for even small beats. Could hear noise when there is no sound as well. I asked for replacement, even the replaced one has the same issue. Don't buy this product."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Product is not best because product it damged volume button cutting ... Damged proudest is packed please retun my product..i am not happy your products.."
Go for it if you have a professional work to do and want reliability in your meeting for audio connect and sound quality
""
Build quality is good.Sound quality is nice.Working very well with oneplus smartphone.Value for money product.Go for it.
I thought it was waste of my time because this product is not working properly and also amozen customer care not responding properly for returned items & refund amount details ...
Battery backup is very poor in this price amount range battery playback time only 10 hrs and many brands below this price range is very good battery backup upto 40 hrs in just 1499 rs
It was working good for first three weeks then i started having problems of buzzing and sound tear. The problem was having in iphone 6s& iphone 10.But when i took my brothers android phone there was no problem at all.
After some time mic stopped working and now looking for replacement but not able to find any related service or online pick up. How do I replace it??
"I like this earphone, best quality...!!"
"Less than a week into usage, product stopped charging unless I turn on the device and off again. Secondly, the audio output would randomly cease while playing YouTube or Amazon music."
I have bought this product 2 months before and it completely stopped working in 2 months.  Initially stopped working one side then completely stopped. It is expensive and there is no quality. very disappointed.
Getting crackling sounds even though it is replaced once after purchasing for the first time. You can have oppo neckband over this
having hard time pairing with device it does not get on even after multiple tries does not get connected yo the devices and no lights work to see whats going on with the headset m sure this is a fake one
Worst product ، in warranty period your device will not be repaired showing some nonsense reasons ،Please don't buy any product of oneplus
Nice product
I was able to use for more than 10 days without charge. ie) the battery doesn't drain when it's idle. Overall the best!
I had purchased this headset on Dec 2021. Sound & base wise ok but voice is not while talking with others. Please guide me to replace headset as this is in waranty period.
I liked very nuch
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 After 2 month hard using still 2 days music backup.Product is absolutely very good.Worth it's price.I recommend it."
Bluetooth connection is very poor. It will take time to connect when we unattach magnetic buds. Some times we have to connect by choosing bluetooth device.Realme buds work better here.
Crackling sound continues
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Quality of the product need to update... Paying 2000/- rs.. Not 100 or 200rs..If we pay 2k and not evening using 20months!!!"
Excellent.. it should have more power backup and 13+mm driver
Good product
There is crackling sound in background most of the time. I replaced it and heard crackling sound again.
I am very happy to buy it...i am buying it for my partner and he is very happy and giving me feedback that it's so nice for sounds and easy to access...nice products...
Lot of disturbance while taking calls through this neckband. Can use it only for listening to music now. Dint expect this from OnePlus product.
"I purchased this product in september, but microphone was  defective and i replaced it within a day. new one only worked for 2 months and it left speaker stopped working."
Average sound quality with boom bass. Battery backup is good....this is for who wants bass....but I like balanced audio and quality so my choice under 2000 OPPO M31  best and upto 5000rs no one beat oppo......
No problem with the product so far. Very fast charging. Good connectivity. Overall great product.
"Everything is good but mic is not very good,"
When I call someone in crowd. Receiver says that very noisy sound hearing.
its bery good but one of ots have not hearing i am using this with iphone 12 pro max it is very compatible for ios and showing battery percentage easly auto connected
Excellent product
One of the best buy I had ..excellent product
Battery life was not enough as it was told that 17 hour and sometimes it was came a beeping soung and encrypted music so it was very bad thing I was experienced
No showing quick switch feature. Even after feature and detail option shows it's there but product doesn't have that. Wrong information provided.Don't buy if you want to use quick switch feature.
"Awesome product, specially battery backup is very impressive. Sound and audio quality is also fabulous"
"First my husband bought boat but it has some connectivity issues, battery life is not good.... So skip to oneplus it's more better than boat"
Good battery backup and easy to carry in pocket and around neck. Good Bass. 5/5
It is simple to use and the clarity is beyond compare
After 10 days use It is generating noise while calling.Now I am stuck because the replacement period has been over.
It's having good bass.just need to improve its ear fitting.connectivity and range was amazing 😍 little bit improvement in battery life 20hr was to less feel the music
"It would have been better if the volume buttons were seperate.. like the non bass edition.. It's only required if you are much of a ""bass kind of songs"" or else the non bass edition is better for wfh or other works"
Good One
"Light weight value for money. Fast charge , battery backup excellent"
I brought 2 ear phones left side ear phone stop working in 30 days hate 1 plus
Dislike  because this item had brok 😒 I am not able to listen  the noise  because wire is not work properly 😑  1yerar warranty bt I am not able to return or replace this item
In my previous one plus BT there was a quick switch button from where both the connected device can be used. Same was mentioned in this also but don't know how to switch & from which button. Of possible plz guide..
Overall this neckband is good. Soud quality is good but base is more . Build quality is very good. Battery backup is very good. So I recommend to purchase this product.
The earphones are truly superb. Worth every penny. Just go for it. As usual Amazon delivery is prompt. I am just loving my earphones
I want to return the product because it is not connecting with my dell laptop.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The product Died within two months"
Box I have received in which there is manual guide no red cable club welcome card no warranty card what is this ..this is the joke of company
Good sound qualityGood product price wise
"All things in this neckband is amazing.You can blindly trust on this, no issue when play bgmi.Don't think too much go and buy this beastOnly thing that I didn't like is delivery boy he was so rude ."
Nice product....good battery life....good on/off feature.....fast contesting.....bass something low but almost good
Superb
"Try to grab a deal during sale or special offers , worth the money !"
"Defective product was given but until I recognised it it was too late to be returned so I request not to buy it. I dislike this product,defective part delivered. Not a trustable shop."
Don't buy this product........ mic problem....
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Dear teamBluetooth unable to connect past two weeks. We need to solution. Please do the needful priority basis"
once charged...forget for three four days
I seriously don't like it with brand promises with big name and work only for one month and now it is dead it's not working anymore
It doesn't even turn on. The rubber part in the earpiece is torn and seems as already been used. It's just closed with ordinary cello tape.
It's very good 👍 product. I was very agressive before getting.It sound quality awasome and product quality like speaker and wire also beautiful ❤️.
Thank you OnePlus for such a wonderful headphones. Good battery standby & Sound quality.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Earphones: Not working"
This product all over good but problem is disconnection using continuous 2 - 3hr. Sound quality is the best but some disturbance during playing songs like listening on FM radio.
I started listening old songs too much... With OnePlus bullets. You have to spend atleast ....between 4-5k to get this level of sound quality.
"This is much better than others, If someone is looking in the same price range then it would be a better option to go with the OnePlus Bullet wireless Z bass edition. I like sound quality with bass."
Bought these first in August 2020. They stopped working in April 2021. Then exchanged them as it was in guarantee period but the new ones also stopped working in now.  Its a scam and very disappointed in Oneplus!
Worst product for income and outgoing calls it is only used for listening 🎧 music waste ..Don't Buy This product I request Everyone Not To Buy
"Not even one month and I am facing issue in calls. Noise due to bad connectivity while calls, totally disappointed with product, not even getting return or warranty details. Also, unable to replace"
Nice and good value for money
"Build quality is great. Sound quality is not that awesome, but you can't expect the best sound with SBC and AAC codecs in Bluetooth earphones."
Sb chij badhiya hai bsss ek kami h dual device pairing ka option ni h
"Battery last 2 daysSound quality is nice , not a big bass lover so it works.Really light weightCharges quickly in 15 min"
Not recommend
Don't buy this headphone for gaming purpose
I want to exchange the product. Yesterday only I unbox this one . Return date is over. Please help me to exchange the product
Dislike after completion of six month it's taken too much time to charging and discharge in just 5-6 hours. Over all bad experience with this product not happy below star rating from me side
I dislike switching option is not there which was in old edition. Otherwise it's nice product.
"Worst quality headphones, i used for 25 days and it's not working at all. I have to go in city for service centre which will cost me around 1000 rs.. don't buy this."
Good product
"Frequently going to sleep mode if you are not using and takes time to activate , very bad quality for the price. Every time I have to disconnect and connect again ..."

"Totally value for money product. Superb sound quality (including bass), build quality, brilliant battery backup. Absolutely worth it!"
Not compatible with my redmi phone...very low sound..returning it back..dont buy if you have any other phone than one plus
I used the. For more than 3 months they are only good for battery life as they are not so good in bass sound quality is okay .
I bought this for me but this is useless product. Even though these don't exchange this product. Not worth it don't buy this product.
It's not good what is the use to have noise cancelation option its not working
Mic totally useless.
"Sound quality was average, Mic was not working, Bass quality was deteriorated. I returned this product 2 times. Hope!! One Plus will deliver good quality product again for which it is known."

I have made purchase 4 months ago.. now one side ear piece is not working .. Not long lasting .. I don’t know they will produce the replacement or not !!
Good sound
Best headfones
After a month there is crackling noise during calls and is too irritating as you cannot hear what the other person is saying . It disconnects in between and takes a minute to reconnect .Waste of money

 Sound quality best noise cancellation good h base bhi best h but one year ke andar hi khrab hi gya h on nii hi raha h"
Recieved a fake product with different design than original one & morever it was defective one..what is worst is that amazon is not helping with its return ..overall a pathetic service
Amazing product. Great sound quality very easy operation. Best the auto switch on and auto connection feature that makes it different from others
The sound quality and build quality is simply superb very flexible  the things that I observed is while listen the songs when we try to increase or decrease the volume some disturbance os occurring
Value for money
Don't ever buy this product.. I used it for 10 days and now it's not charging. My earphones battery is now fully dead.. worst product.. buy this product is a big mistake and totally waste of money
noise clearance is very  bad and in I am playing the video voice breakdown I am not expected from these product I have paid 1999 it is a not small amountI dislike the Bluetooth
Great sound quality. U will enjoy watching movies and hearing music. Recommended.
"Okay product nothing's wow, same as some regular product at half the price"
Good
Within 4 month headphone got dead. Now it's been 1 month I have submitted that headphone to service centre for replacement still they are saying we don't have stock. This is the Worst experience

 Superb product with excellent sound quality  and bass."
Good quality wireless earphones. A power button would have helped a lot though.
The voice clarity is very good which means a lot.  Listening to songs on this headset seems to be floating in the air.  I do not know how to say more than that.My thanks to one plus and amazon
"Everything is good, except the problem of one side speaker is not working since 4vdays...."
Please I request not to buy this product there is not clear voice and also after one week there is no chance of exchanging the product also and crackling sound is more don't waste your money. Am Highly disappointed.
I'm Satisfied with this product and one plus services I'm using this one year so good quality sound bass so go this product
Good for the price. Can't hear on the top volume . To get comfortable sound need to keep volume on middle..
Everything is good but it's not working and now am unable to download it's invoice for changes please helo me or send it's invoice on my Gmail
Getting frequently disconnected. Audio quality is also good..
All are awesome but having connectivity issue... Sometime its not connected or not visible in pairing device.. Also if m scaning its not found... Having this issue continuously..
Kuch time mai khud hi discounted ho ja raha hai/battery issue/kuch time baad hi voice atak rahi hai kat rahi hai
"Bought twice, there are noise disturbances that don’t go away, some sort of glitch, crackling sounds in between playback like when adjusting radio frequencies on a radio"
"I have been using the same product earlier,but never faced this problemBut now the new one has connection problem while talkin ,other wise everything is same .Got it changed once but the problem persists."
I am using this one from last 2 months. Very Easy to connect and converse in phone calls . Good sound for listening 🎧 songs....Very flexible to connect multiple devicesGreat to go for one plus
"This product was not satisfied call noise is verry high, talking time fully break, not clear voice hearing, very irritation, I bought very high expectation but not worth it"
मेरे को गलत आइटम भेजा गया है जिसकी कंप्लेंट मेने पहले से ही कर दिया था लेकिन उसके बावजूद भी कोई समाधान नहीं हुआ है जिसके में कंज्यूमर कोर्ट में रिट लगा रहा हूं अगर मेरा जल्द कोई समाधान नहीं हुआ तोप्लीज
Not great in terms of sound n battery
"Quality and connecting speed of the earphones is good. Battery backup is also sufficient , You can use it throughout the day in a single charge ."
"Clear sound quality, noice cancellation work's perfectly, battery backup is good and charges quickly.Trouble when switching between mobile and Laptop. Should support double pairing or quick switch."
From the first day it’s not working properly. The battery backup is poor that it last for maximum an hour with minimal usage even after full charge. Disappointed !!!
"Bought this on a deadline to be used on my trip,but sadly charging issue or system issue don't know.I was highly relaying on one plus quality but sadly the accessories have been disappointing."
Noise cancellation issue ...Double device not connected ...Sound ok ...Bass ok ...Not use on bike ....
""
Good battery backup plus clear sound with bass
Bad experience with Amazon and one  plus  bluetooth headset purchase this product in previous month November  now December 3rd December not able to use just because  bluetooth not working
Product is good but not for too long calls and audio
When you connect it with iPhone there's crackling sound.Buttons don't respond.Charging issues.Not worth buying
"The Quality of the product is not up to the mark,the sound crackles like a bubble wrap continuously also they DON'T HAVE A RETURN POLICY,if they do have Kindly Contact me.Regards"
म्यूजिक क्वालिटी जितनी अपेक्षा की जाती है वनप्लस से वह  इतना प्राइस देने के बाद भी अगर  नहीं मिलती है तो निराशा होती है म्यूजिक क्वालिटी को इंप्रूव करने की  आवश्यकता है

 Nice earphone"
I only got the charger in the box. The earphone is missing. I have recorded video while opening the box. I want refund.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Its not even a month since i bought thisAnd its sound quality is getting worseIt has started making crackling sound in background"
"Everything about this is nice the sound, the bass and the texture feels really comfortable. Lightweight. The sound and bass can be better but it is a good in this price range."
"Nice features, it switches between 2 devices seamlessly with stable connection, battery and call quality is good, no bass, I doubt if there is any noise cancellation."
Pure quality stuff
After 2 months perfect battery backup but when you call someone voice is not clear to the other side 😑😒
"Sound quality + noise cancellation everything is good,but when we connect 2 devicesEx- one plus 7 & a macbook, the switching is not all smooth + the sound is distorted"
It's battery life and sound quality is good but sometimes connection is problemSometimes connect and some disconnect automaticallyFacing problem with connecting to device
Sometimes during connecting voice will be distributing but mostly it is very good
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I am disappointed this time from Amazon such a well known reputed organization because I got damaged used product which is even different product."
Some crackling sound heared on calling.Customer care tell me this issue in phone.And Your phone software is old.Please don't bue if you have 1 year old phone.
Everything is super...Must buy without any thinking... Value for money..I am fully satisfied... Thank you Amazon for first delivery..I got it within 5 working days. ..
Battery life and sound quality worst. I'm just praying for durability of the product
I recieved a wrong and defective product and delivery boy deny to puch up return very bad experience with this totally  money waste and now I m facing so much in progress of return
My Bluetooth stopped working within 6 months. When I tried reaching One plus for replacement under warranty they did not entertain my concern. Worst service
Good
There is crackling sound while hearing on phone. Not a good product as it seems to be.
Average
Good
"Battery is amazing, but the sound quality is not that top notch like crisp and clear. It's the 'Bass Edition' thats must be the reason. But overall the product and is build quality is 🔥"
Iss jaisi bass aur clear volume kisi bhi earphone ki nhi hai it is bestttttt.....Agar kisi ko lena hai toh full paisa vasool hai aankhe band kar ke khareed le aapa paisa waste nhi jayega
This earphone disconnects a lot while calling with iPhone. Does not allow me to speak even for a min. Disappointed with the purchase. Saw different blogs and it seems similar problems faced by many.
It has got no direct switching functionality.
While playing Youtube audio background noice disterbenceWhile playing game audio cuting sounds like in milli secconds or like stuck feeling
Good
Dominating Bass ... if you go with full volume u can't enjoy the music. Ear drums will start paining
Great back up of battery
"The product seems good in all ways, but it is not completed 1 year also, the ear phones are not working."
Very good build quality and sound system...and also give a good battery backup at minimum charging.....fast charging supported....i can use it 2-3 hours regular without any irritation and headache
Very good product from oneplus. I feel it is satisfactory product. Very less time it takes to charge. Sound and backup is also good
I HAD BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT IN JUNE AND NOW WITH IN 4 MONTHS ONE SIDE BUD IS NOT EVEN WORKING. AND WITH AMAZON NO OPTION OF CLAIMING WARRANTY AS WELL.THIS PRODUCT SUCKS...
All an all its a good Bluetooth neckband at the price quoted. Won't call it exceptional but gives better results. Does charge quickly and if used properly battery lasts long enough.
Because this product some time disconnected & auto connect on when you play music and you tube and games and etc............ Every 15 to 20 minits auto disconnected & connect
Dual pairing at a time is not working. This feature most important now a days. And the earphones are big size not comfortable in ears. Wrost product overall.
Nice brand and good quality
Good battery life
Post one month use of this products getting crackling sound in the background that comes during calls even while listening the audio. Bass also not good comparatively. Wast of money.
"Don't ever buy this product initially it was working great not even 5months, one earbud stopped it's work there is zero sound u can hear. Selling fake products at Amazon"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 While conducting the webinar my voice is not there. When phone to other and friends they do not hear my voice. Noise concellation is also not working"
"Sound is not clear, cracking sound comes after few days uses, I also replaced the product but the result is same, not recommende, go with  realme or other brands."
Nice qualityBuilt structure awesomeBullet in ear fit to earC_type cable charger
Battery backup of this earphone doesn’t meet my expection.Bullet wireless has more battery backup than bass edition.Overall its good except battery backup
I am facing charging issue in my One Plus Bullets Wireless Z Bass Edition only red light shows while charging for a long time. Kindly replace the product.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Sound is very low speaker problem please check the quality in starting bluetooth is very good working after some months they get in trouble"
In warranty n the product is not working and one plus store has not repaired the product
I hate battery backup really I hate...  Old version earphone is best as compared to this
Bad product.with bad quality sound . Don't buy it through amazon .Amazon doesn't even help you to return or replace and neither they talk to you .my product is in warranty period I want to return
Value for money. Using now for more than 2 months without any issues. Sound quality is superb.
Its awesome product guys well mannered packedThe quality is very rich must buy this nackband its battery backup is awesome clear sound pleasent sound
Amazing sound and mic quality
Battery life is good

Ok
Mic quality of this product is very bad. It gives very low sound just after 10 days. Very difficult to replace the product as there is only one OnePlus service center in Bihar.
Very Good Product.Sound Is Very Clear And Bass Quality And Battery Backup Is Too GoodDelivery On Time And Nice Receive...
Sound quality is amazing. Have used TWS buds from other brands ... Had issues.. so switched to neck band and this is amazing..
"The Cable broke within 15 days of purchase, just 5 days after the return/ replace period. never expected from a brand like One plus"
"Voice is not clear some sort of noice is coming, noice cancellation is not working, sound quality is also not good."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Got a opened product. 0 stars"
"This is supposed to be the bass edition but the bass is missing with a lot of treble. Poos sound quality. Defective, duplicate or simply a bad product, could be any."
My husband like this
"Event though the sound is good, but opposite person wont be able to hear your voice. Have to sent it to service center within one month. Bad product quality delivered."
The sounds good but the problem is that the mic isn't working at all. And it haven't even been 24 hours. Decided to test out the quality of the mic but it didn't work at all.
"One side earphone is not working,it's 9 days old unit. Received on 18.08.21,I am trying to raise a complaint in call center but it's not connected, worst product,overall service is not good"
I ordered 1st one plus wireless Bluetooth that was some time getting switched off automatically not getting on2nd device full of distapence no voice clarity
"Left side of my wireless earphone is not working. It's been only few months, but it has one year warranty. Waiting for the response, i want to replace it."
"The build quality is good. Personally, I did not find the sound quality up to the mark, plenty of room for improvement. Great battery backup, easy controls and no issues while on calls"
For android it is good but for iphone after hearing songs for more than an hour there is a temporary disruption. Apart from that better for the price.
worth for money & Excellent product to use

 Bluetooth connectivity issue"

I have bought one plus bluetooth but after 1 week I am facing problem there is connecting problem and also voice is lacking and no body is helping from one plus so please don't buy.
With in 2month voice breaking issue. No ervice station in all districts. Very less service senters only available in TN. Trichy servicecentre response is very bad.
The left earpiece stopped working in 7 months. Is there a warranty replacement available for this product?. Good sound quality although...
"Three after using this I'm replacing this.Some sound similar to a small tick can be heard which makes this neckband unusable, Let's see if the replaced one is good."
It's a faulty product.no warranty given.fake product.
"After one month, mic not working just using for audio, if you visit customer service centre they tell lots of stories and tell like mistake with you"
"exept phone calls quality, everything is good. music + gaming (very low delay) a must buy."
good
"Battery percentge showing only in multiple of 10 like 100%, 90%,80% and 100% to 90% is only for one call its getting down soon. Cqn you replace this item soon"
Good product
"yes I like this Oneplus Bullets Wireless Z Bass very much. small small issues only, but overall good product."
"Excellent product. However, there is some wire design issue that gets disconnected after 3-4 months of use."
No noice cancellation
Amazing bass
If the purpose is only music then best one to go.Want to use for calls then don't consider this.You will get cracking noise during calls..

 Mujhe dusra headphones chaiye 1months m voice gayab ho gyi yeh problem 3rd time face kar rha hu 1months m"
"Received a fake and cheap product, and now I am not able to return the same as amazon is asking for image verification, which can't be possible without receiving original product."
Good product which has a decent sound quality.Battery backup is just awesome. Charging time also very less since I'm using OnePlus dash charger.
Not bad. Average product.
Awesome product mind-blowing thanks Amazon for giving original productNahi to r bhi online application h sab original k nam p.local product chipka dete h
As we all know that @oneplus is pioneer in making good quality gagets .It has a great sound quality and are comfortable...Nice fit in ears
I purchased this product on 23rd june and after 10days it stoped working. Opposite person not able to hear my voice
In 2nd month it just got switched off and couldn't restart it again
Just go for it. It is pure value for money. Rather than buying 2 1000rs earphone in 1 year go with this one.
Great buy but it is showing some problems in ascepts of charging not getting charged since yesterday night
The mic picks up too much wire rubbing noise when used while walking or working
Very useful for Online classes
I'm so happy this One Plus Bullet Wireless Bluetooth HeadsetSon Nice ProductThank u One plusAnd Special thanks For Amazon...
Should have a manual switch off and on button cause sometimes those magnets stick together and the earphones are switched off while we are using.
I think I Have got a defective piece of product. Lot of electrical noise which may be due to defective components.I want replacement as I trust the brand till now
This headset is not working after 2weeks.Just emitting dim LED and not getting started.No response is coming back even if we press any keys...I wasted my money on this product
Best blootooth
அதுருது
Need to improve... expecting for new launch
"Really gud product and it's up to my expectations.. pretty decent bass, vocals and audio sep . Worth buying it at this price point.. May not be gud for apple users. Best for oneplus users.."

 No power, not working"
"Good quality, super sound ❤️, connectivity also very good 👍, flexible, But the problem is the same that you cannot adjust the wire size according to your own."
Excellent Sound quality with bassStand by mode is superb
Excellent bass and good sound quality
Excellent 👌
In this product calling experience was very very poor. In one plus service station There was many customers are there for this fault. There no any solution for the fault.
"At this price range,this is the best,built quality is amazing,high quality rubber,sound wise its promising."
It's been just a month i bought these earphones and one of it has stopped working. I can't even return it now and totally not worth the money i spent on it that is 2000 rs.
Bad one. I hardly used it for 10 days and the return window is closed. The voice is becoming blurred now and then in between conversation. Not audible many a times. Please don't buy.
Product quantity gud one plus trusted brand . Most important battery backup two gud also support fast charging
The sound after connecting to laptop is very low.It doesn't include quick switch.No proper service after claiming for warantee.
"Everything is fine except the mic doesn't work properly. While speaking through a call, caller at the other end don't hear properly. Would have given 5star if the mic worked properly."
The product is good. It fits well. Noise cancellation level is also ok.
Like
Best headphone in these range. But need to improve built quality...last version of these headphones much better in built quality.
"No noice cancellation, sound quality is ok for music but very poor quality for talk on calling with any network.  Wrost experience , vaste of money"
In this price range Oneplus bullets providing great sound & perfect bass
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Very nice, i like very much, for music listeners u feel best experience with it, but while talking on phone it receives surrounding sounds more"
Battery back up is poor....does not last much...also...there is no power button..which i think should be available
Good Product
Bass quality is normal as compared to Sony. Incommig Call quality to be improved. No cover for type C charging port.
Excellent Product... Sound Quality is excellent. Smooth in ears..Bass Quality is Good... Original Product is delivered.Battery Back Up is Good..Value for Money

Good bass quality and fast charging 15 minutes Full charged
Product is very good sound is good and the base is good and super to carry
Address on OnePlus care is incorrect for service center which cost me further 200rs to reach at service centre. Telephony never picks up your call. Took ages for a email reply
The sound quality is great but the battery backup is not as expected
After month 1 side not working... No damage nothing.. just stop sounding.. money wasted
Very Impressed From This Product And Easy To Use Very and Very Useful For Calling And Bass

"साउंड क्वालिटी, वायर की क्वालिटी, अच्छी है लेकिन इसके mic में वॉइस कॉलिंग अच्छी नही है। सामने वाले के पास आवाज कभी कभी सही से नही जाती है। बैटरी बैक अप भी अच्छा है।"
Alot of issues with connection and voice disturbance and also unable to connect during drive. Bass has an issue and alot of pain in the ears
Okay.
"One of the best Bluetooth headset ever, i had few expensive products before but with these quality and comfort it gives is great and also with good price, just go with it"
Sound quality and bass is better
Sometime shuts down with no response. Even 8f put on charge or connect to laptop. There will be no response. After some time it get started automatically.

Takes 15 minutes for 100% charge and runs whole day. Sound and bass is also nice.
Sound and Bass quality are good.Battery is the key mention for this headset.Compared to any other product in the same range this is the best.
"Worst product it's very insult for brand one plus,after one month mic not working properly... while every call I want to disconnect bluetooth and take a call at normal"
Thought of taking it as I use one plus phone only but it stopped working in 15 days. I keep charging it but it doesn't start at all. can't change it as it has crossed 10 days now.
Sound became very low even in full volume they didnt gave warranty card in packing now i can not avail warranty of my productDont buy one plus
Average product

Product damaged &I have to change city for replacement as I am currently in another city
Males buzzing sound during call. Microphone is attached to the neck band which is why you need to speak louder while taking.
Not working
Lil bit eco in the sound is annoying if takling on a call with only one bud.
Very good quality

Sound quality is really good.
"Overll good now, should give regularly this product with customer services. Money also Worthfull for our india 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳 expectations....... All the best👍💯"
Battery backup very low compare with boat rockers 255 pro+
Excellent quality
"Worst product, with in 2weeks instead of noice cancellation it started giving noice to the receiver, very bad, it's not like previous quality!!!"
Good product friends
"It's very bad ,no quality check before dispatch..Defective product receivedlet's see how they will return my payment"
"Received a duplicate product. Found multiple damages on the body. Charging port is Micro USB, However the charger is USB-C. This is not expected from Amazon. Feeling cheated."
Most important thing is sound quality is best part and bass both are superb.
My ears soon start paining after I use it.
Excellent
Excellent quality. Super bass. Excellent battery life. What more needed to be expected? I truly recomend this one.
I disliked the product because it is not working and this was not expected from a one plus product. I think Amazon has given me fake product.
"Worst product it only works good for oneplus products.If its connected to ther brand devices like samsung and asus laptops, the cracking sound starts and poors the audio"
"Poor noise cancellation, while making or receiving the call not clearly listen. Voice breaking so many times and little more improve need in bass quality."
"Upto the mark, 3 weeks use 12 hrs play back time"
Great Product.Excellent Sound effect.I love it.

Best one for bass users I'm using it 1 month and only bass lovers will enjoy and over bass so I always reduce the sound to 70% and it good to hear
Not good but ok
साउंड quailty is very good .But Bluetooth connection problem.
"With reference to the price, this product is justifiable with a decent cost, quality is good and I am satisfied by using it on iPhone/ one plus and MI phones.."
Worth buying this product.its user friendly
"Both the actual item & replacement item showed same issue (rattling sound when connected to laptops).So, this is definitely a product level bug. Worst product from OnePlus"
"Pathetic headphones, no quick switch button.. they are misleading the customers. Don't buy"
Sound quality is good. Connectivity is excellent. It connects automatically in a second. Gaming performance is also good. You won't notice any delay.
Very comfortable. Value of money. You can use it for a long long time. Rubber quality is excellent.
Value for money...Sound quality good.External noise completely bandManufacture quality is excellent. Over all the product is awesome.
A really nice product from one plus. But it feels painful for longer usage
Best earphone in 2000 price range. No need to research just buy it.
Using Oneplus product for the first time.. very satisfying.. very attractive box.. and sound quality is very good.. recommend.. Thanks for the very fast delivery Amazon..❤
Best earphones under 2k. No research needed.
"In Just one month, these headphones have already gone bad. Huge noise, disturbance and voice breaks during calls"
Bass is really poor.Automatically gets of and takes time in getting on.Sound quality and mic quality is very poor.Battery backup ia satisfactory.
"Over all product is good, sound quality, Barry life is ok but noise cancellation is not there..."
Very nice n clear
So far nice. Have to explore much. After usage of few months I will give the exact feedback.

Earlier one was great because in this Mic is much back so person can't hear properly as well to disconnect it takes long time Infact unable to disconnect many times.
I loved this product.
Except call make feasility rest all very very good
One side ear bud is not working within a month of purchase. Nowadays online products are not worth to buy most of the time you will get used or damaged product.
LaaJawab bemisaal must Buy
Good for music as echo sound there phone calls have little problem
"Connectivity, Battery Life, build quality, comfort everything is great expect sound quality too much bass I wish I could exchange it with non bass edition 😔😊"

Please spend those extra few bucks and buy this.Superb battery and awsm sound!!!!Worth every s ikk ngle penny!Thank me later :)
A very very bad item. Suddenly dameged. It has not been Changed
Customer service service is not good.If any issue is raised the same is not solved.This review is after using almost 1 year.
Worthy product. But  little Costly
"Every thing is goodI got it for 1999 rupeesReally goo product to buyIf we keep 10 mins charge, we can enjoy upto 10hrsRecommended one"
Excellent Product With Hearing Capacity..I Would Recommend This To Everyone.. Battery Life Is Amazing 👌 Keeps You Going For Hours Together.
NICE
"Don't buy this blutooth, beacuse after some days unable to connect with Mobile, automatically disconnected, India's third class Bluetooth"
Blindly buy product. Best in classss
This wireless earphone does not connect with OnePlus nordBluetooth doesn't work properly it doesn't get connectedReally disappointed
Return period was over. Oneplus has only few service centers. So very difficult to get it repaired. Utterly disappointing 😞.
"Not buy,  sound quality is good but always slipping from ear."
Good sound quality and even charge remains for atleast 2hrs if used continuously and best to buy
The product is not working. I think I received a fake product. But my return time window is also over so cannot get replacement.
Sound quality good but not long time work quality was bad
"Don't buy this product from Amazon, this is duplicate and the battery is not working more than 4,5hr properly...😖😖😖😖N not excepting return request."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Product is used damage and accessories are missing worst experience ever"
It has an awesome Bass and a decent call quality with a mind blowing battery life. The build quality is also top notch.
Quality is not good after 6 months use one side not hearing  .
When connected with a device the connectivity does not maintain and the sound starts blurring.Worst experience from OnePlus
Product was very good and his sound quality is good and bass quality is super goodMy suggestion is everybody was used this productand try it
"little bit extra (whooh)  bass , it you can adjest in equliser ,  over all very good audio quality"
It's not just about bass.Sound quality matters which this product is not able to give.Didn't expected this from ONEPLUS.DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY
Meri pasand oneplus Bluetooth isliye Hai Ki yah bahut Shandar volume bhi bahut Shandar voice bhi bahut Shandar सबसे शानदार इसकी क्वालिटी
with this price range it is too good. Main thing is it's charging time ..you can can plug in it for just 10 minutes and get a backup of 10 hours that is really satisfying.
very poor quality product I just used 3months but now lt is working
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Dislike product not working wasting Money"
"Does not connect often, it takes time."
Perfect balance of bass & treble
Continuously disconnecting whenever paired. Not in any perticular situation. Very dissappointed with this one. Please let me know what to do.
"This product was good but gradually its sound quality become worse, in calls sound is not clear, even one plus earbuds service centers do not respond"
Quality product. Sound is very balanced. Must buy
"Battery Life not as suggested by the product description....Noise cancellation is poor, sound quality is fair"
Sound is gd and also bass but no noise cancellation is thre and battery life is less so i m very sad about this product
Sound is good but volume button doesn't work properly and volume button was broken if I removed the cover plastic over volume button.
Nice one time investment for this 🤠
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Work properly worth to buy it in 2k range it is undoubtedly best option."
"Good bass, super audio,high durability, worth money, 16 hrs play music, easy on/off mode."
Fantastic experience beautiful colour gone madThe only drawback I have is the keyboard and it's emojis otherwise the experience is fabulous
It’s a good buy. Charges up quickly in minutes … doesn’t take hours to charge.
Nice product but they are not giving discount
Good
Mike kharab huwa ekahine me ...itma mahenga liya but risult acha nhi muje ye vapis Krna hai....nhi to kabhi mai Amazon se shopping nhi krunga muze ye Cheng krke chaiue
Oneproblem :-When I call someone ..sound dorp. I'm used 4 month ..🙁Almost good.
Amazing product.. Great sound..
"Bought this product one month before, but now one of its earbuds is stopped working. Waste of money."
Very nice product
Product is useless I bought it on 13th march 2022 and on 29th of it's not working properly there is a very irritating sound in background
Worst & No bass quality
Its been just three weeks since I brought this but one of the side is not wroking.. really pathetic.. added to that you cannot find a service quickly ..
Bluetooth is no more connecting after 5 months of use. Boat Bluetooth is more worth buying and works longer than this
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 It's like one of those return products coming from other customers. This was unexpected."
"Often voice gets distorted when in calls but works perfectly when listening to music, etc. It's frustrating because my phone is also from the same company."
Its really good quality and battery works well. Connecting 2 devices helps with both personal and work requirements together
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Sound quality best 1 plus branded productsBass quality bestColour best black🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩"
Very bad experience with this ear phone ones charge will not last longer for more than 20 min and it's completely off again I need to charge fully to use it
Amazing Sound Quality. Dumdaar Bass. Light Weight. Worth Price. Best bluetooth headphone available in the market. Battery wakeup is awesome. Totally a Masterpiece
They aren't last long quality..
Best for calling. Worst for music lovers. I have purchased it for calling purpose only. Cost is high.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 It's a good productGood sound quality and ""C"" type charging port"
Overall experience was awesome
It's very nice.This is my 5th order for OnePlus bluetooth
"When talking on the phone, the sound does not come rightThere is a nice sound when listening to the song but a very bad sound on the call"
Best earphone under 2kSound -4 out of 5Bass-. 4 out of 5Clearity -5 out of 5Comfort 5 out of 5Black colour outstanding 🤩🤩
Owsum
"Good quality,nice sound, everyone to buy this product"
"Waste product, it’s stopped working within 10days of purchase and no return policy…"
"I'm using nearly 4 month's , now it's not working, some times Bluetooth connectivity very bad . it's like connected and within seconds disconnected, weast of money."
It's been only a month.. it's not working properly. There is a disturbance when I am on a call.. sound quality is okay.
"The worst product I have ever purchased. Within one month of purchase, sound is not coming from one earplug. A very bad product and not recommend to anyone to buy this."
There's a small 'tak tak' sound which is clearly heard at the beginning of every song.. and also during slow music.. it's annoying!! Leaving that the product is amazing!
It was very useful neck bandBest sound qualityHigh bassValue for moneyThe interesting thing is  it turns off when the earbuds conected together
Its not able to catch up your voice easily. You need to speak louder for that. I was having much more expectation but didnt proved that much
Really good product. Compare to previous version of bullet Z this is really good. Battery backup is also good. It gives around 15 hrs of battery backup.
Every time I have to manully connect my laptop. Once I restart my laptop device not connect automatically. I have to go blutooth and pair again my blutooth headphone.
Not working properly with laptops.I think some driver or software issue is.Need to update.I've tried with hp &dell laptops. But working fine with mobile
Good quality headphone .once charging is full then it will working 4 to 5 days normal use of Mobile .
"There is no zero Star option so had to give one Star at least, it continuesly disconnecting while in use waste of money also the service of OnePlus very poor"
"Initially product looking amazing but after few months it's not working properly ,I think defective product delivered to me ."
31 December 2021 को मेने ये प्रॉडक्ट लिया था. अब 2 महिने बाद आज ओ अचानक से फोन पे बात करते करते बंद पड गाया. मुझे इसका replacement चाहिए.
I m so disappointed with this product I will never buy one plus or suggest anyone .with in one month it stopped working Please don't buy this product
"Good earphone, but don't buy if you are looking for quick switch"
I have used base edition earlier (which stopped working after 14 months). This one is having crackling sound (even with replacement).
Bass version way Better than regular one plus bullet earphones... Go for it if u want better call quality and of course the sound
Amazing product
Boom boom
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Bad reception while talking over the Bluetooth (static voices)"
A scratchy and disturbing noise on phone calls but not when watching YouTube videos. Great bass.
"Left side bud is very delicate , i want to use warranty , because it's not completed one year even , how can I claim warranty 🥺😭"
Some quality is good ... Bus after 2-3 months that headphone not working properly ...wastage of money ..
Missing Data cable and buds rubber and old bluetooth is get in packet packing open very dirty product  i will return thise product
Like the sound quality but uncomfortable for long use..
Costly

 I bought this OnePlus bullets wireless Z on January 8 and it is not pairing with any devices"
Super good bass.
The media could not be loaded.
Not working properly and also making noise. Calls also gets disconnected.
This is 2nd one and within 3 months right one stopped working also the magnetic switch has stopped working too
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 My earphone has not working and sound also not coming from earphones I want to replace"
Sound quality was bestAnd build qualityBass looks batteryEvery thing it's awesomeMy favourite now OnePlus
"Getting lot of noise after one month of usage. Not suitable to take up calls and have a conversation, its like talking when a big machinery is running next to you."
Expected better. Crackling noise coming from one of the ear buds from day 2 itself. Replaced one product and even with the second one same issue exists..
There's background disturbance in earphone. It is not expected from an expensive earphone
"Not working, they send the defective productReally bad experience from the seller"
It's not working only.. after 6 days of buying..want to return it..but there is no option of returning...I hate this product..damaged product.. Amazon sends all damaged product
Baas thoda jyada hai
Best product
"After some days you will find that u can not receive call with this . U must have to use phone for it ,"
"Sound is ok, bass quality not good, it stop working in just 2 months... Bad product, don't buy it..."
It's not matching as per applied cost. Sound Quality is poor and very disappointing. I am getting disappointment after receiving product.
Cheap and best
"got the product on time and started using it, i really like the sleek design and the sound quality is really good,, !"
"Ko replacement garrannty nahi, mera eare phone 6 mahine me hi kharab ho gaya lekin wo log na repair karke de rahe na replacement"
"Amazing good battery,music bass top"
Poor quality of product from OnePlus.Major service centres in Kolkata are saying they are not providing headphone service
The material used is premium quality.The bass is amazing.The device connects very quickly the time taken is less than 3 secs.*just buy it.
Excellent product
"The sound is good , its really not soo clear in higher volumes and it's a bit louder even in 3/4 sound . Its overall a good one to buy and has an excellent battery life"
The brand comes up with another reliable product. Worth buying 👍🏻
This is a rip off of previous oneplus bullets 2 which were golden compared to this bronze the bass makes this terrible
Back to back 2 product delivered in dead condition first vivo v20 pro than after OnePlus bullets wireless z black earphone is delivered in dead condition.
It's been only 2 months I am facing problem in sound output. It's like a static sound while playing audio. Please buy at your own risk.
Value for money. Satisfied with this after trying some other products in same price range
The product stopped working within 10 days of purchase
"Some times not connected to phone, it is headache, you have to give on and off specility to blue tooth. It is important."
It's a good earphone from OnePlus and it's overall good but they need to improve in the bass and increase noise cancellation
Sound quality is good
"They claim its low latency headset, but its not. Can't play games with it.Mic catching surrounding sound more than my voice even if i hold it close to my mouth"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Clarity of voice and connectivity with 2 phones is tedious and unsuccessful with this device."
These headphones are exceptionally good.Excellent base and sound quality. Long battery life is plus-plus. Highly Recommended.
Good and excellent
I have been using this product since last year and I haven't got single change in its performance and qualityThanks 1+ it really mean it
"After 2 month of use voice calling is not satisfactory, voice is not properly coming and cutting down the voice during the call"
Not a great enthusiast in bluetooth headphones.This is my first BT headset that too from OnePlus.It proved its worthiness for that 1999.satisfied and would also recommend it for others
"Quality good, but it is not suit for my ears"
Excellent Product...Great sound quality...using it since 5 months...loved it...worth purchase...Go for it
Only dislike one thing that in new version OnePlus remove switching button. Otherwise overall product is good.
The total sound quality and noise cancellation is brilliant and it's highly comfortable to hold in ears. The product quality is top notch.
It's sound quality is very good and is worth of money
Magnet quality is low otherwise it's value for moneyBest part is no delay in sound when you play games
I lost my old version. So bought this bass boosted one. Totally spoiled the decent quality of sound it offered in the older version. Utterly disappointed.
"Very awesome product by OnePlus, sound quality, noise cancellation & bass quality is too good and I’m loving it. Thank you Amazon!"
The quality of plastic is not good. It's broken near the volume button
i got my order delivered today and the earphones were missing from it  im really disappointed with it and i want my money back as soon as possible.
These are the best earphones. Don't go with the other brands .The only problem is that it makes clicking sound when bass reaches high in some song..
"Good built quality, battery life is good too. Call quality is excellent. Only complaint is about its clarity, not entirely bad, but could have been crispier."
Stupid product don't buy no quality voice break in between songs and two times I exchanged no use waste of money
Bass is good.
Bht hi mast earphone g 2000 ki range is se best koi earphone nai h bass bht mast h.or rating bh is range sbse jyada. Jisko bh 2000 ki range earphone leni ho to best h yeh👌👌

 Left said sound quality is not working properlyPlease replace this product. Tank u"
Very good
If you are music lover this product is definitely not for you. A friend Have bough boats Rockerz 225 for 1000. They have better sound then this.
"Suddenly disconnect from my phone during call or listen music, noise cancellation not work properly, Issues in connectivity...."
"do not buy this, one side of the earphone shops working within few months . same happened with my friend. it doesnt last long."
1.Good design2.Good sound quality3.Good Battery capacityBut it is better to charge the device upto the indicator turns into white as it lasts longer.
"Instead OnePlus , JBL product recieved and it seems it is a fake product.Strong action is recommended against this type of act"
"Is product pe kuch tym k bad call pe Bluetooth connect ni hota,,awaj pause ho jata hai"

I don't like this product defective product delivered and refund is not initiated yetKindly please refund my amount as soon as possible
Worth it really one pluss is unbeatable andAnd bass is awesome
Wonderful product
Sounds are quiet clear and bass quality is one of the best it's quiet improved. Noice cancellation can be improved it's good but expect more of it.
Sound is so balanced and so comfortable to wear...

This Bluetooth is very good quality of sound and bass i feel each and every song it's one of the best headset👌👌

Didn't like the audio quality the base is boosted and it makes problem in hearing to lyrics.
Worst oneplus product I ever had I return it twice and got same problem which I had withe first one
Battery bahot jaldi khatam hoti h aur 2-4 month me pura kharab ho gya apna to bekar product h ye 😡
"Only go for with one plus devices, do not buy if you have samsung device or an apple"
Sorry to say that my oneplus bluetooth headset not get connected to phone.shows not able to connect.Not useful now.only two days i could use.
I think these are one of the best wireless earphones you will get at this price point.It does the job that's all I have to say
This product is most exlent bt only connect the phone then hi disconnected automatically 😒😒😒😒
Not great in noise cancellation... Every time I receive or call .. during conversation Got irritating sound ... Have to disconnect the  call  sometime..
All over good but there is one problem I am facing after one month microphone was not working this was a very bad experience.
It switches on/off along with the magnets and its super speed to connect to the phone works great.
Sound quality from right earphone is not good. it has grrr sound from right earphone.Not good quality.defective
"Best neckband in the current times! Just go for it dont think too much, you wont regret!"
"Sound quality , noise cancellation , bass quality are awesome and also good power saving wireless 👂 phon"
Some irritate sound when calling..one plus alwats best..but this piece noy good for me..i think i again re order for this...i ll returned
i purchased one plus one month before.value for money product. nice bass and volume control. battery back up is very impressive. 10 min charge time is enough.

After a long time using one plus earphone wire have been cut from the joints.
Plz don't bye spl from online bcs there is issue with connection after few days when returning period is collapsed . My suggestion don't bye ever

good
Nyc wireless Earphone..super fast in connect with phone.bettery is okay (8 to 10hours)
Over all the quality is good but bass is not up to mark as I expected from one plus.
"This earphone is waste of money, whenever I'm connecting to PUBG and use it. The voice is not going and if it is going it's very feeble"
All know about one plus product. Its beyond my expectation. Its a very nice product bass of the head photo is wow.
Very bad experience… crackling sounds from the first day of use… got it replaced twice!!! Same problem twice!!But Amazon gave a quick refund..
There is only one issue that it is slightly uncomfortable after 30 minutes of listening.
Missing that quick pair mutton from wireless z.Good improvement on bass .
"Liked the connecting speed with mobile, bass quality is too gud, noise cancellation is not that gud, when in crowd it recordes more noise itself"
Noise cancellation is as good as not there. The other person can hear when the slightest horn or bird chirping from far away.
"Not a good product by one plus battery issues, mic is not working properly."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Damage earphone within one year.... Service centre not take this product also"
Sound 🔊 quality is too good as compare to any other earphone 🎧.
This is a really amazing product by one plus. Good battery backup. Charges in 10 mins which is really good for busy people. Value for money 👍.
Excellent
WORST PRODUCT AS AFTER 15 DAYS WHEN I ATTEND CALL THEN THE RECEIVER HEARS LOTS OF DISTURBANCE AND PATHETIC PERFORMANCE TOOO.

 Rubber dameged  And wire losing"
Nice
There is no extra Bass added..... Don't bye Bass lovers...
Wearing for long time it's not comfortable.Sound and build quality good
Order the same item a few days ago with a sound better than the one currently ordered blutooth and its sounds and bass pretty very bad
I don't like this kind of issues at all.This problem started after the replacement peroid over.How to replace it now is a big question.
You should buy this only if you are using one plus device  bcoz the response of this neckband with other devices is not good and the main prblm occurs on calling..
I am not satisfying with this product. In 2000 range worst wireless headset. Only sound is there no bass and no quality.
Good one
It's not like old one which they use to sell with name of OnePlus Z bullet earphones.
Really like the headphones but they constantly keep disconnecting from my Samsung S10.
I believe in the One Plus product a lot and it's not good at all The sound of this project is very bad
Thank you oneplus sound 🤞 i like it that's product quality is very high i am impressed oneplus neckband

I using this neckband is very poor sound quality. When I use to connect connect with Bluetooth it is not properly work.
Used old product has been sent . Very poor product.Bad bad baf
"It's useless no noise cancellation function, sound quality not upto the mark... Price comparatively more than other brands with similar functions.."
They are best amon or under 2000 but I think they are little overpriced than realme and boat ones over all happy to buy this.
It's really owsam product and sound quality is very good with good base. Thank you oneplus of best products intimate ammount.
Build and sound quality awesome. Pairing speed is unbelievable
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 When we make or receive any call, not able to hear anything. Worst product"
Had to replace the item first as the mic was not working. The one I am having now also seems to have very bad mic reception
The best thing i liked about this headphones is it connects to the mobile device even before i plug it into my ears.
Overall quality excellent but with noise cancellation not satisfied
Perform for musicNo noise cancellation

"Liked a lot this wonderful product, enjoying sound quality and it's features. Features are awsome"
This is bed item and i want to replace it . There is sound priand noise disturbance like radio sound. Please return it.
Creating very irritating noise while call making for self and others.Seems defective piece but didn’t expect from oneplus.
All ok but while calling it catches high frequency background noises but still good as compare to other in this price range.
Battery life is superb its charge very fast.. the thing is missing is not receiving incoming calls automatically in iPhone..
Very bad... Buttons are not functional... Oneplus support also not helpful
I like it and good sound effort

Super bass qualityEasy to auto on off when connected to magnet
"I received this product on 24th June and got damaged on 7th July, worst product..kindly do something."

Very nice product i am very happy Thanks you for Amazon
All are ok but when are connected this device to Bluetooth then some after time it  can disconnected automatically.It can't connect continuously.
"If Product is not good then how is it possible sound quality, noise cancellation is good, think it."
Utterly ridiculous product much better buyer can buy road side Bluetooth product.Any phone calls came we cannot hear clearly.
A very premium product...... quality wise it's perfect 👌...... Considering about price.....it's worth it....The sound quality is balanced very appropriately!
"Good in terms of battery lasting, Sound is not bad, bass effect is lesser than expected.. Could have been priced 300 bucks less.."

Battery backup is not very good
"Good quality .... Sound clarity,bass ,design, fit, pairing device everything is good but noise cancelation while driving is not that much good."
It's overall okay but there should be more clear user manual so that there will be no issue while connecting with different devices and paring or unpairing
"Costlier than Realme, mi, boat and other brands but the money which you spend on it will be worthy for it."
Connecting issue and righ side earphone not working after 10 days
The sound quality is awesome and the charging is very quick and long lasting. It is good for gym use also.
Old product received and damage also volume and power button Missing from the box and box is already open condition
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Both speaker damage and other products delivered  bad product received"

Off course sound quality is good  ....But the voice is break ...I can't clear listening the audio ..... That's way i'm replace this item.....Thank u amazon😍
So Nice
Very good
Very poor quality. Device stopped working in few months post purchase.
Hardly 1 week it worked fine . But after a week when I am trying to call someone. There is so much noise when ring goes to the other person.
"Nice audio, good to carry, neck bend quality is superb, Battary backup is superb, bass is superb but not like 255pro plus.."
Best wireless Bluetooth at affordable prices. The battery backup is very good.
"Not comfortable for ears, but other quality is good, battery in nornal use is about 2 day for some call and video streaming not continues."
Now when I m talking to another peopleThe connection is not happening why ?But I m playing audio video that quality is superb
If you are music lover don't buy it. But battery🔋 life is good.
"Nice performance.The Brand Oneplus says everything.Worth buying.Thanks,"
No vibration for call.. very bad lot's of call missd coz off no vibration .
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Its one earphone stopped working after 3 months and we don't know what should we do"
If one plus bullet wireless z bass edition has a charging slot cover in earphone for protection then it will be more good.
Not perfact base..just okay
Sound quality and base is good. Some time voice stop coming automatic disconnected.Overall experience is not good with this product .
Bass is nice . sound quality is good.comfortness of wearing have to be  more better than current condition.but overall is nice product.
"Crackling sound coming during on call , neee to fix by switching BT on/off ,"
The built material is not goodMy band's one bud is not working in less than 1 year and one plus is also not ready ti take this issueSo plz don't buy this
Frequently disconnects from laptop.Tried with another laptop and its same issue.
I like the bass quality great bass but song next not support

Nice product
"Sound quality is excellent, noise cancellation works very well.Connecting online for meetings is very satisfying for the attendees"
"Very nice sound quality, build up quality, noise cancellation quality, is very very very goodThankyou oneplusपैसा वसूल प्रोडक्ट"
Worthy product
"You are selling either dublicate or defective products. This will led serious consequence's in near future. Headphone not getting switchon, even after charging."
"Even after 3,4 hours of charging, red lights did not change into white, which indicate full charging.also some time charge very slow"
Seems like fake product. Worst design. No power on/off button. I don’t know when it will switch on/off. Bass quality is poor.
Bass is good and fit in ears.connectivity is excellent
After connecting with system the incoming voice breaking.
Bass is upto the notch and that's what we expect from this.overall build quality is good
Not worth it. Mic is pathetic
Premium feel
Neckband of a great quality. Oneplus is a great choice. Happy with the performance.
This product is not working
It is not too good as described. Sound and bass quality is normal as other low price earphones. But battery backup is best.
It's not working properly on public area. Too much noise issue with called person so don't buy.
Good sound quality noise cancellation work very well....
Sound quality is superb.Bass quality is also goodAn overall good product in a good range

Right side ear phone stops functioning occassionally
Sound quality is fantastic but the battery life of this headphone is not as given by one plus
"Sound quality is average, but major problem is Bluetooth connectivity. Not a 1999 worth product...."
"Unhappy! No quick switch button, it is very sad to see after receiving the headset. In the features it was mentioned up to 3 devices."
Stopped working after 10 day. Even after full charge it will not contact to mobile
It's better than other Wireless air dopes but we love air buds... If you want to have wired just go for This. Awesome
nice product
*value for money*clear voice*flexible*deep base*power optimization if good*connectivity is too fast
I did not got one+ Bluetooth itself only accessories bill warranty card were there in box. Requested to return or replacement of this order.
For fifteen days initially after buying it was okay. Now not giving sound and wavering sound  . Kindly replace it or refund it

Really good
pakka quality high bass with clear sound no noise value for money
"Premium product, Excellent battery backup, connectivity and navigation ..also very comfy to wear due to the flexibility of the cable"
Mike is not working and sounds quality is very bad I'm not satisfied with this product
Overall pretty decent. However not the best fitting.keeps falling inspite using the smallest size bud
Nice audio with headphone like bass
Not up to the mark my expectations sum noise notice while driving or calls not clearly listen calls some issues
The cord is not as expected ..it will tangle in the neck together and difficult to remove it during emergency calls .. sound quality is excellent.
The ear buds silicone are hard and little uncomfortable
"The media could not be loaded.

I am so happy to this headphones too Awesome sound Quality.
Please dont purchase it because crackling sound continuous comes  while using for  calling and online classes and no bass quality.

 This project quality low 2-3hours change ing and 10 hours battery backup"
"Good battery life, easy and quick charging, best sound quality"
Battery back up good ..But can't talk when you riding..
Worst quality at this price range its better to buy under 1k because its quality is same as that
Must buy
Overall good but buzzing sound comes while calling anyone
I didn't expect this from one plus but its losing it's credibility
Sound quality is really good. Bass is enhanced in this edition. Sound distortion is negligible at higher volume
"Mic is the worst, whoever I call tell that they can't hear me properly. Don't buy this."
In this price Sony neckband are also available but their quality is not that much good and it's connectivity is excellent must buy products

 डिलीवरी देने वाला मेरे को माल भी नहीं दिया वापस लेकर चला गया आज आया था वापस लेकर गया"
"Amazing productsI am use this product.Extreme quality outstanding  ,Good Battery backup & sweet sound."
Poor quality of body wires came out of earphone very poor mic very poor inception waste to buy and invest in like this …
What is waste of money. I paid 2k just to hear static noise. Even cheaper earphones have better quality than this.
"It's a very good product and good sound quality and bass quality.But, Normal audio call I am facing some problem."
I like everything about this bluetooth wireless bullets
Excellent product
Convenient to use. Good sound quality. Reasonable battery back up. Need to charge after 2-3 days usage only.
Good
It's also good neckband for clear and chrispy sound for gamers response time is fast. Under 2k this is the best.
"Battery life is very good, bass is also better.But I am not satisfied with its noise cancellation."
"THe bluetooth frequency jams the WiFi frequency, they're both of 2.4GHz. Connecting is a headache, and quick switch feature isnt available anymore."
Sound quality is good but while record something it's not seems good (outside voice are highlighting) especially whatsapp app voices
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Bahut achha earphone hai sound and bass or battery 🔋 achha hai flexible brand"
"Earphone is good for listening music but for calls I give 0 rating , because it doesn't have noice cancellation , background sound is more than person voice."
"Earphone quality is really good, sound quality is also awesome"
Mike is not working properly.Reciever unable to hear my voice.
Go for it..... BlindlyCompetiition can't match the  quality & price in the same league
Sounds quality is 10/10Noise cancelation is 10/10Bass quality 10/10Overall the best for all music lovers.
Nice product but sound quality and connectivity is not good
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Not for gaming"
Sound Quality is really good.
"Nice product, good Build quality, sound quality also very good, call clarity also good ..Only one cons - No dual pairing"
"Sound quality and base was awesome , within 10 mts 💯% charging . .but only defect calls are frequently not connecting with Bluetooth"
Worst product. We can't even trust branded products. They are selling defective product. Really disappointed.
"Sound quality battery performance , rubeshed used ... No 1 quality .. he is very best .1 plus is world best company"
Over all it's a  good product there is little sound while talking on call. it's a awesome product. You should buy this product.
Just OK
There is some kitch kitch kitch noise when I listen songs after connecting it with my mac bookSo its not working with mac os
Received defective product and i have used my friend earphones it sounds very good and great sound quality .
Base is Super Awesome.Great Quality and steady look.Easy to use.
"One side not working, where i go to claim warranty for this"
Product is average.......Amazon pay use karne k bad bhi 10% cashback ni aaya.I never use Amazon in future.
I bought it on basis of my previous experience with this bullet wireless set but it iratrating to switching paired devices from new one.
"easy to use, very comfortable, some times I am facing noise cancellation issue apart from this it's very good👍"
Best products after use of 2 months and its value for money
"So the body of earphone is a overall reversed.Position  of earbuds are opposite not comfortable  wearing those , going to replace them."
The BT neckband is good or rather decent but not hat great. I'm sure you'll get better products at a cheaper price.
""
Nice purchase...
Overall quality of the earphones is good. Must buy.
I am already using the oneplus bud z but the quantity oneplus bullets wireless provide is far superior than the buds z
"My wireless bullet Z while light is not going off.Even if I join the magnetic ends of buds it does not go off,  !! Not able to reset or connect phone"

In music mode it's sound quality awesome but during calls it's pathetic as sound quality is vulnerable.
